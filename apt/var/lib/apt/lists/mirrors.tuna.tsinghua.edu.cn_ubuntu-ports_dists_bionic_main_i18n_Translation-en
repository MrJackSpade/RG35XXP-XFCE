 Anacron (like "anac(h)ronistic") is a periodic command scheduler.  It
 executes commands at intervals specified in days.  Unlike cron, it
 does not assume that the system is running continuously.  It can
 therefore be used to control the execution of daily, weekly, and
 monthly jobs (or anything with a period of n days), on systems that
 don't run 24 hours a day.  When installed and configured properly,
 Anacron will make sure that the commands are run at the specified
 intervals as closely as machine uptime permits.

 Advantages:
  * Built-in ANSI X9.17 RNG (Random Number Generator)(CAST/SHA1)
  * Built-in password quality checking system (now it has support for Bloom
    filter for faster access)
  * Two Password Generation Algorithms:
     1. Pronounceable Password Generation Algorithm (according to NIST
        FIPS 181)
     2. Random Character Password Generation Algorithm with 35
        configurable modes of operation
  * Configurable password length parameters
  * Configurable amount of generated passwords
  * Ability to initialize RNG with user string
  * Support for /dev/random
  * Ability to crypt() generated passwords and print them as additional output.
  * Special parameters to use APG in script
  * Ability to log password generation requests for network version
  * Ability to control APG service access using tcpd
  * Ability to use password generation service from any type of box (Mac,
    WinXX, etc.) that connected to network
  * Ability to enforce remote users to use only allowed type of password
    generation
 The client/server version of apg has been deliberately omitted.
 .
 Please note that there are security flaws in pronounceable
 password generation schemes (see Ganesan / Davis "A New Attack on
 Random Pronounceable Password Generators", in "Proceedings of the 17th
 National Computer Security Conference (NCSC), Oct. 11-14, 1994

 Also note that the FIPS 181 standard from 1993 has been withdrawn by NIST in
 2015 with no superseding publication. This means that the document is
 considered by its publicher as obsolete and not been updated to reference
 current or revised voluntary industry standards, federal specifications, or
 federal data standards.
 .
 apg has not seen upstream attention since 2003, upstream is not
 answering e-mail, and the upstream web page does not look like it is
 in good working order. The Debian maintainer plans to discontinue apg
 maintenance as soon as an actually maintained software with a

 It supports processing source files by running TeX and related tools
 (such as output filters, post processors for generating indices and
 bibliographies, and viewers) from inside Emacs.  AUCTeX allows browsing
 through the errors reported by TeX, while it moves the cursor directly to
 the reported error, and displays some documentation for that particular
 error.  This will even work when the document is spread over several
 files.

 AUCTeX can automatically indent LaTeX source, either line by line or for
 an entire document, and has a special outline feature which can greatly
 assist in getting an overview of a document.
 .
 AUCTeX is written entirely in Emacs Lisp, and may therefore be enhanced
 with new features for specific needs.  It comes with a large range of
 handy Emacs macros.  It is a GNU project, and documentation for all its
 features is accessible via the Emacs info browser.

Description-md5: 12127f5bccf4c38c80c33e34f12556eb
Description-en: Tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from
 files called `Makefile.am'.
 .
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
 of the Automake maintainer).
 .
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
 .
 Automake 1.15 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11 and 1.14 did, so previous versions are

Description-en: high-performance, enterprise-grade system for backing up PCs
 BackupPC is disk based and not tape based. This particularity allows
 features not found in any other backup solution:
  * Clever pooling scheme minimizes disk storage and disk I/O.
    Identical files across multiple backups of the same or different PC are
    stored only once resulting in substantial savings in disk storage and disk
    writes. Also known as "data deduplication".
  * Optional compression provides additional reductions in storage.
    CPU impact of compression is low since only new files (those not already
    in the pool) need to be compressed.
  * A powerful http/cgi user interface allows administrators to view log files,
    configuration, current status and allows users to initiate and cancel
    backups and browse and restore files from backups very quickly.
  * No client-side software is needed. On WinXX the smb protocol is used.
    On Linux or Unix clients, rsync or tar (over ssh/rsh/nfs) can be used
  * Flexible restore options. Single files can be downloaded from any backup
    directly from the CGI interface. Zip or Tar archives for selected files
    or directories can also be downloaded from the CGI interface.
  * BackupPC supports mobile environments where laptops are only intermittently
    connected to the network and have dynamic IP addresses (DHCP).
  * Flexible configuration parameters allow multiple backups to be performed
    in parallel.
  * and more to discover in the manual...

Package: bdf2psf
Description-md5: 5eb98031ca1e36678eeeefee0d31085b
Description-en: font converter to generate console fonts from BDF source fonts
 This package provides a command-line converter that can be used in
 scripts to build console fonts from BDF sources automatically. The
 converter comes with a collection of font encodings that cover many
 of the world's languages. The output font can use a different
 character encoding from the input. When the source font does not
 define a glyph for a particular symbol in the encoding table, that
 glyph position in the console font is not wasted but used for another
 symbol.
 .
 When deciding about the position in the font for a particular glyph,
 the converter takes into account that in text video modes the video
 adapter copies the eighth column of the glyph matrix of symbols
 positioned in the pseudographic area to the ninth column. In order to
 create fonts for text video modes, the width of the glyph matrix of
 the source BDF font should be seven, eight, or nine pixels; otherwise the
 converter creates fonts suitable for framebuffer only.

Package: build-essential
Description-md5: 90ef0ef86cafda0bd16f746eb621d9da
Description-en: Informational list of build-essential packages
 If you do not plan to build Debian packages, you don't need this
 package.  Starting with dpkg (>= 1.14.18) this package is required
 for building Debian packages.
 .
 This package contains an informational list of packages which are
 considered essential for building Debian packages.  This package also
 depends on the packages on that list, to make it easy to have the
 build-essential packages installed.
 .
 If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
 a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
 package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.
 .
 This package is NOT the definition of what packages are
 build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
 This package contains merely an informational list, which is all
 most people need.   However, if this package and the manual disagree,
 the manual is correct.

 chronyd:  This is a daemon which runs in background on the system.
 It obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of the system's offset
 relative to other systems and adjusts the system time accordingly. For
 isolated systems, the user can periodically enter the correct time by
 hand (using 'chronyc'). In either case 'chronyd' determines the rate
 at which the computer gains or loses time, and compensates for this.
 Chronyd implements the NTP protocol and can act as either a client or
 a server.

 o  The tool is loosely based on the SVR4 crash command, but has been
    completely integrated with gdb in order to be able to display
    formatted kernel data structures, disassemble source code, etc.
 .
 o  The current set of available commands consist of common kernel core
    analysis tools such as a context-specific stack traces, source code
    disassembly, kernel variable displays, memory display, dumps of
    linked-lists, etc.  In addition, any gdb command may be entered,
    which in turn will be passed onto the gdb module for execution.
 .
 o  There are several commands that delve deeper into specific kernel
    subsystems, which also serve as templates for kernel developers
    to create new commands for analysis of a specific area of interest.
    Adding a new command is a simple affair, and a quick recompile
    adds it to the command menu.
 .
 o  The intent is to make the tool independent of Linux version dependencies,
    building in recognition of major kernel code changes so as to adapt to
    new kernel versions, while maintaining backwards compatibility.

Package: dbus
Description-md5: 8317e43242716ec7f7692a3ac5895e1c
Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Package: dbus-user-session
Description-md5: be4453093922af92deac14b4e8458a83
Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.
 .
 See the dbus package description for more information about D-Bus in general.

 A daemon that dynamically updates a relay authorization map for some
 MTA (postfix, sendmail). It provides a way to allow legitimate users
 to relay mail through an SMTP server, while still preventing others
 from using it as a spam relay. User's IP addresses are added to the
 map immediately after they have authenticated to the POP or IMAP
 server. By default, map entries expire after 30 minutes, but can be
 renewed by additional authentication. Periodically checking mail on
 a POP server is sufficient to do this. The POP and SMTP servers can
 be on different hosts.

Package: eatmydata
Description-md5: 4dad1280628a46c312954a4d1ba76a96
Description-en: Library and utilities designed to disable fsync and friends
 This package contains a small LD_PRELOAD library (libeatmydata) and a couple
 of helper utilities designed to transparently disable fsync and friends (like
 open(O_SYNC)). This has two side-effects: making software that writes data
 safely to disk a lot quicker and making this software no longer crash safe.
 .
 You will find eatmydata useful if particular software calls fsync(), sync()
 etc. frequently but the data it stores is not that valuable to you and you may
 afford losing it in case of system crash. Data-to-disk synchronization calls
 are typically very slow on modern file systems and their extensive usage might
 slow down software significantly. It does not make sense to accept such a hit
 in performance if data being manipulated is not very important.
 .
 On the other hand, do not use eatmydata when you care about what software
 stores or it manipulates important components of your system. The library is
 called libEAT-MY-DATA for a reason.

Package: fonts-sil-abyssinica
Description-md5: 8fccebec6e37d1916d24db0127e8c0c5
Description-en: smart Unicode font for Ethiopian and Erythrean scripts (Amharic et al.)
 The Ethiopic script is used for writing many of the languages of Ethiopia
 and Eritrea. Ethiopic (U+1200..U+137F) was added to Unicode 3.0. Ethiopic
 Supplement (U+1380..U+139F) and Ethiopic Extended (U+2D80..U+2DDF) were
 added to Unicode 4.1. Abyssinica SIL supports all Ethiopic characters which
 are in Unicode including the Unicode 4.1 extensions. Some languages of
 Ethiopia are not yet able to be fully represented in Unicode and, where
 necessary, non-Unicode characters were included in the Private Use Area.
 .
 Please read the documentation to see what ranges are supported
 and for more about the various features of the font.
 .
 Abyssinica SIL is a TrueType font with "smart font" capabilities added using
 the Graphite, OpenType(r), and AAT font technologies. This means that
 complex typographic issues such as the placement of multiple diacritics or
 the formation of ligatures are handled by the font, provided you are
 running an application that provides an adequate level of support for one
 of these smart font technologies.
 .
 This release is a regular typeface, with no bold or italic version
 available or planned.
 .
 More font sources are available in the source package and on the
 project website. Webfont versions and examples are also available.

 Two fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:
 .
     - Ezra SIL version 2.51 (Containing the basic set of Unicode
        characters needed for Biblical Hebrew texts following the
        typeface and traditions of the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia.)

        characters as above but with a different style of cantillation.)

Package: fonts-sil-nuosusil
Description-md5: d6ea72c7c14321fad5939a643e9354f8
Description-en: Unicode font for Yi (a script used in southwestern China)
 The Nuosu SIL font was originally named SIL Yi and developed in 2000
 as a single Unicode font for the standardized Yi script used by a
 large ethnic group in southwestern China.
 .
 The traditional Yi scripts have been in use for centuries, and have a
 tremendous number of local variants. The script was standardized in the
 1970's by the Chinese government. In the process of standardization, 820
 symbols from the traditional scripts of the Liangshan region were chosen
 to form a syllabary.
 .
 The syllable inventory of a speech variety from Xide County, Sichuan
 was used as the phonological basis for standardization. For the most part
 there is one symbol per phonologically-distinct syllable and vice-versa.
 The direction of writing and reading was standardized as left-to-right.
 Punctuation symbols were borrowed from Chinese, and a diacritic was
 incorporated into the system to mark one of the tones.

Package: fonts-sil-scheherazade
Description-md5: 0c6246880e4da91928734d7d2d2cad86
Description-en: smart Unicode font for Arabic
 Scheherazade, named after the heroine of the classic Arabian Nights
 tale, is designed in a similar style to traditional typefaces such as
 Monotype Naskh, extended to cover the full Unicode Arabic repertoire.
 .
 The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font
 family that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed
 for almost any Arabic-based writing system. This font makes use of
 state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex typographic
 issues.
 .
 This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using
 basic connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional
 ligatures or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef
 ligatures). This simplified style is often preferred for clarity,
 especially in non-Arabic languages, but may be considered unattractive
 in more traditional and literate communities.
 .
 One font from this typeface family is included in this release:
     - Scheherazade Regular
 .
 This release supports virtually all of the Unicode 5.0 Arabic
 character repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks,
 which are not recommended for normal use). Font smarts are implemented
 using OpenType technology.
 Webfont versions and HTML/CSS examples are also available.
 .

 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description-en: ICC color profiles for use with color profile aware software
 Color management allows controlled conversion between color representation of
 input and output devices and color spaces. ICC profiles are an important part
 of color management. They are data files that represent mappings between the
 input or output color space of a particular device and the device-agnostic
 profile connection space (PCS) in accordance with the standards set by the
 International Color Consortium (ICC). This package contains a number of high
 quality ICC color profiles for use with color profile aware software such as
 Scribus, Gimp, CinePaint, Krita, or Digikam. In general this package is
 useful if the software using it was built against a color management support
 library such as liblcms1 or liblcms2-2. In some software such as Scribus you
 have to explicitly enable color managemenent in the preferences to be able to
 use these profiles. The sampleicc-tools package contains tools that can be
 used to manipulate and query the icc profiles in Debian.
 .
 The color profiles in this package are available under free software licenses.
 Additional profiles under non-free licenses are available in the icc-profiles
 package.

Description-en: development files for MIT Kerberos without Heimdal conflict
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a
 third party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").

 /usr/lib/mit-krb5 and can be installed along side heimdal-multidev, which

 transferred if the connection broke. You can start a transfer in background
 and continue browsing on the ftp site. It does this all in one process. When
 you have started background jobs and feel you are done, you can just exit
 lftp and it automatically moves to nohup mode and completes the transfers.
 It has also such nice features as reput and mirror. It can also download a
 file as soon as possible by using several connections at the same time.
 .
 Lftp can also be scriptable, it can be used to mirror sites, it lets you
 copy files among remote servers (even between FTP and HTTP). It has an
 extensive online help. It supports bookmarks, and connecting to several
 ftp/http sites at the same time.
 .
 This package also includes lftpget - A simple non-interactive
 tool for downloading files.

 Apache2::Reload reloads modules that change on the disk.
 .
 When Perl pulls a file via "require", it stores the filename in the global
 hash %INC. The next time Perl tries to "require" the same file, it sees the
 file in %INC and does not reload from disk. This module's handler can be
 configured to iterate over the modules in %INC and reload those that have
 changed on disk. It can also monitor only specific modules that have
 registered themselves with Apache2::Reload. It is possible to trigger the
 check only when a special touch-file has been modified, minimizing the number
 of stat() calls per request.

Description-en: C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic
 duration class . Examples of time durations include days, minutes,
 seconds and nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number
 of clock ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are
 united with a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
 represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
 epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a
 particular platform: system_clock, steady_clock and
 high_resolution_clock. A clock is a pairing of a time_point and
 duration, and a function which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
 current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time
 spent by the current process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures
 system-CPU time spent by the current process.
  * A tuple-like class
 process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU, and system-CPU
 process times together.
  * A thread_clock thread steady clock giving
 the time spent by the current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.

 a sparse Cholesky factorization, solving linear systems, updating/downdating
 the solution to the triangular system Lx=b, and many other sparse matrix
 functions for both symmetric and unsymmetric matrices. Its supernodal Cholesky
 factorization relies on LAPACK and the Level-3 BLAS, and obtains a substantial
 fraction of the peak performance of the BLAS.

Package: libclass-accessor-perl
Description-md5: 478fde937a7300dacb3834b3ffdba459
Description-en: Perl module that automatically generates accessors
 Class::Accessor automagically generates accessor/mutator methods for your
 class. Most of the time, writing accessors is an exercise in cutting and
 pasting. If you make your module a subclass of Class::Accessor and declare
 your accessor fields with mk_accessors() then you will find yourself with a
 set of automatically generated accessors which can even be customized.

Package: libclass-data-inheritable-perl
Description-md5: 82bba9e65b0ab1d72fbef1e5e404c956
Description-en: Perl module to create accessors to class data
 Class::Data::Inheritable is for creating accessors/mutators to class
 data.  That is, if you want to store something about your class as a
 whole (instead of about a single object).  This data is then inherited
 by your subclasses and can be overridden.
 .
 For example:
 .
 Pere::Ubu->mk_classdata('Suitcase');
 .
 will generate the method Suitcase() in the class Pere::Ubu.
 .
 This new method can be used to get and set a piece of class data.
 .
 Pere::Ubu->Suitcase('Red');
 $suitcase = Pere::Ubu->Suitcase;

Package: libclass-method-modifiers-perl
Description-md5: f1e6913eb390add5f060deebe6e85707

 Class::Method::Modifiers provides three modifiers: before, around, and after.
 The before and after modifiers are run just before and after the method they
 modify, but cannot really affect that original method. The remaining modifier,
 around, is run in place of the original method, with a hook to easily call the
 original method.

Package: libclass-xsaccessor-perl
Description-md5: e785abcf076fde905048821573ca8b98
Description-en: Perl module providing fast XS accessors
 Class::XSAccessor implements fast XS accessors both for getting at and setting
 an object attribute. Additionally, the module supports mutators and simple
 predicates like those for testing the truth value of a variable. It works only
 with objects that are implemented as ordinary hashes.
 .
 The XS accessor methods were between 1.6 and 2.5 times faster than typical
 pure-perl accessors in some simple benchmarking. If you usually write clear
 code, a factor of two speed-up is a good estimate.
 .
 Refer to Class::XSAccessor::Array (also included in libclass-xsaccessor-perl)
 for an implementation that works with array-based objects.

Package: libclone-perl

 nested hash, array, scalar and reference types, including tied variables and
 objects.
 .
 It is faster (although less flexible) than Storable's dclone. Its
 functionality is _not_ serializing in-memory objects (i.e. as
 Data::Dumper or YAML::Dump do), but deep-copying them over to new
 in-memory structures.

Description-en: concise sparse matrix library
 Suitesparse is a collection of libraries for computations involving
 sparse matrices.

 The performance of the sparse factorization methods in CXSparse will not be
 competitive with UMFPACK or CHOLMOD, but the codes are much more concise and
 easy to understand. Other methods are competitive.

Package: libdata-dump-perl
Description-md5: 9bbf0dc5bb559b810cac86ad8408084b
Description-en: Perl module to help dump data structures
 Data::Dump provides a single function called dump that takes a list of values
 as its argument and produces a string as its result. The string contains Perl
 code that, when evaled, produces a deep copy of the original arguments. The
 string is formatted for easy reading.
 .
 If called in void context, the dump is printed on standard error instead of
 being returned. If you don't like importing a function that overrides Perl's
 not-so-useful builtin, then you can also import the same function as "pp"
 (the mnemonic for "pretty-print").

 any common date/time manipulation easy to do. It aims to make operations like
 comparing two times, calculating a time a given amount of time from another,
 or parsing international times simpler.
 .
 The focus of Date::Manip has been to be able to do ANY desired date or time
 operation easily, though not necessarily quickly. There are other modules
 that can do a small subset of these operations quicker, so if speed is a
 primary issue, you should look elsewhere.

 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.

Package: libdevel-callchecker-perl
Description-md5: 249ac69288b749749c86a5b98de59aeb
Description-en: custom op checking attached to subroutines
 Devel::CallChecker makes some new features of the Perl 5.14.0 C API
 available to XS modules running on older versions of Perl.  The
 features are centred around the function cv_set_call_checker, which
 allows XS code to attach a magical annotation to a Perl subroutine,
 resulting in resolvable calls to that subroutine being mutated at
 compile time by arbitrary C code.  This module makes
 cv_set_call_checker and several supporting functions available.  (It is
 possible to achieve the effect of cv_set_call_checker from XS code on
 much earlier Perl versions, but it is painful to achieve without the
 centralised facility.)

Package: libencode-locale-perl
Description-md5: 56ab0dbfeb69a085703b46539790f388
Description-en: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
 based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
 .
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
 in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding
 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

Description-en: Perl module for error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
 The Error module provides two interfaces.  Firstly "Error" provides a
 procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly "Error" is a base class
 for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can
 simply be recorded.
 .
 Errors in the class "Error" should not be thrown directly, but the user
 should throw errors from a sub-class of "Error".
 .
 Warning: Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the
 black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its
 maintainers have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage
 people from doing so.

 Recommended alternatives are Exception::Class (libexception-class-perl),
 Error::Exception (not packaged), TryCatch (libtrycatch-perl), and Try::Tiny
 (libtry-tiny-perl).

Description-en: static library for flex (a fast lexical analyzer generator)
 Flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. It reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. Flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.

 GD::Graph is a perl5 module to create charts using the GD module.
 The following classes for graphs with axes are defined:
 .
  * GD::Graph::lines - Create a line chart.
  * GD::Graph::bars - Create a bar chart.
  * GD::Graph::points - Create an chart, displaying the data as points.
  * GD::Graph::linespoints - Combination of lines and points.
  * GD::Graph::area - Create a graph, representing the data as areas
    under a line.
  * GD::Graph::mixed - Create a mixed type graph, any combination of the
    above. At the moment this is fairly limited. Some of the options
    that can be used with some of the individual graph types won't work
    very well. Multiple bar graphs in a mixed graph won't display very
    nicely.
  * GD::Graph::pie - Create a pie chart.

Description-en: Galois Field Arithmetic - development files
 Galois Field arithmetic forms the backbone of erasure-coded storage systems,
 most famously the Reed-Solomon erasure code. A Galois Field is defined over
 w-bit words and is termed GF(2w). As such, the elements of a Galois Field are
 the integers 0, 1, . . ., 2^w − 1. Galois Field arithmetic defines addition
 and multiplication over these closed sets of integers in such a way that they
 work as you would hope they would work. Specifically, every number has a
 unique multiplicative inverse. Moreover, there is a value, typically the value
 2, which has the property that you can enumerate all of the non-zero elements
 of the field by taking that value to successively higher powers.
 .

 GLM provides classes and functions designed and implemented with the same
 naming conventions and functionalities as GLSL, so that when a programmer
 knows GLSL, he knows GLM as well, which makes it really easy to use.

 This project isn't limited to GLSL features. An extension system, based on the
 GLSL extension conventions, provides extended capabilities: matrix
 transformations, quaternions, half-based types, random numbers, et cetera.
 .
 This library works perfectly together with OpenGL but it also ensures
 interoperability with other third party libraries and SDKs. It is a good
 candidate for software rendering (such as raytracing, rasterisation), image
 processing, physic simulations and any context that requires a simple and
 convenient mathematics library.

Package: libgraphite2-3
Description-md5: 68d1591bf212ce8230272a42a5738b72
Description-en: Font rendering engine for Complex Scripts -- library
 Graphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart fonts" capable
 of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:
 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified
 through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by
 compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using
 grcompiler.

 socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
 IO::Socket::INET, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.
 .
 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::INET subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
 ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.

Description-md5: 8a817802dc5924f984c4c4e341e15361
Description-en: module for importing packages into other packages
 Import::Into creates a global method import::into which you can call on
 any package to import it into another package. This is useful because
 there are many different ways to write exporters: some use Exporter, some
 use Sub::Exporter, some use Moose::Exporter, some use Exporter::Declare
 and some things are pragmas.
 .
 And if you want to re-export other things, you have to know which is which.
 Exporter subclasses provide export_to_level, but if they overrode their
 import method all bets are off. Sub::Exporter provides an into parameter
 but figuring out something used it isn't trivial. Pragmas need to have
 their import method called directly since they affect the current unit of
 compilation. Import::Into can be used to import packages into other packages
 without having to deal with the specific details of every exporting approach.

 strings.  An IO::String object can be attached to a string, and
 will make it possible to use the normal file operations for reading or
 writing data, as well as seeking to various locations of the string.
 The main reason you might want to do this, is if you have some other
 library module that only provide an interface to file handles, and you
 want to keep all the stuff in memory.
 .
 The IO::String module provide an interface compatible with
 IO::File as distributed with IO-1.20, but the following methods
 are not available; new_from_fd, fdopen, format_write,

Description-en: lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser
 It lets you use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends) as your template
 language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's
 components clearly and succinctly. It automatically synchronizes data from
 your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data
 binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to
 test, AngularJS teaches the browser how to do dependency injection and
 inversion of control. It also helps with server-side communication, taming
 async callbacks with promises and deferreds; and make client-side navigation
 and deeplinking with hashbang urls or HTML5 pushState a piece of cake.

 Underscore is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides a lot
 of the functional programming support that you would expect in
 Prototype.js (or Ruby), but without extending any of the built-in
 JavaScript objects.  It's the tie to go along with jQuery's tux.

 Underscore provides 60-odd functions that support both the usual
 functional suspects: map, select, invoke - as well as more specialized
 helpers: function binding, javascript templating, deep equality
 testing, and so on.  It delegates to built-in functions, if present, so
 modern browsers will use the native implementations of forEach, map,
 reduce, filter, every, some and indexOf.

Package: liblpsolve55-dev
Description-md5: 83ab2a5569e8e5aa48dc0c181dbcf28e
Description-en: Solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems - library
 The linear programming (LP) problem can be formulated as: Solve A.x >=
 V1, with V2.x maximal. A is a matrix, x is a vector of (nonnegative)
 variables, V1 is a vector called the right hand side, and V2 is a vector
 specifying the objective function.
 .
 An integer linear programming (ILP) problem is an LP with the
 constraint that all the variables are integers.  In a mixed integer
 linear programming (MILP) problem, some of the variables are integer
 and others are real.
 .
 The program lp_solve solves LP, ILP, and MILP problems. It is slightly
 more general than suggested above, in that every row of A (specifying
 one constraint) can have its own (in)equality, <=, >= or =. The result
 specifies values for all variables.
 .
 lp_solve uses the 'Simplex' algorithm and sparse matrix methods for
 pure LP problems.  If one or more of the variables is declared
 integer, the Simplex algorithm is iterated with a branch and bound
 algorithm, until the desired optimal solution is found.  lp_solve can
 read MPS format input files.
 .
 This package contains the static library for developing programs using

Description-en: converts plain array images into multi-size representation
 The LiquidRescale (lqr) library provides a C/C++ API for performing
 non-uniform resizing of images by the seam-carving technique.
 .
 The library takes images in plain array format as input and converts
 them to a multi-size representation.
 .
 Following is a list of features:
 .
   * Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard
   * Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done
     in real-time. In fact, the information can be saved and read out
     later without any further processing
   * The resizing is done with a single function which automatically
     performs all the necessary operations; it can also work in
     successive steps without wasting computational time
   * Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be
     less connected, or more rigid, or both
   * Can export and import the visibility map (the seams)
   * Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process
     as the parent image
   * The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by
     selecting among different energy gradient functions
   * Reports progress through a customizable interface
   * A signalling system permits one to cleanly handle errors
 .

 The LWP::Protocol::https module provides support for using HTTPS schemed URLs
 with LWP. LWP::Protocol::https is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so
 you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to access
 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.
 .
 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and
 neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be
 the one provided by ca-certificates.
 .
 This module used to be bundled with libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
 tool-chain. Applications that need HTTPS support can just declare their
 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
 underlying modules to install.

Description-md5: a98b989412e5ed2eb94b6c710889486b
Description-en: minimalistic Netlink communication library (devel)
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the development libraries and header files you need
 to develop your programs using the minimalistic Netlink communication
 library.

Package: libnet-patricia-perl
Description-md5: c0b7febe52570bf0586f14d286ffdf92
Description-en: Perl module for fast IP address lookups
 Net::Patricia uses a Patricia Trie data structure to quickly
 perform IP address prefix matching for applications such as
 IP subnet, network or routing table lookups.  The data
 structure is based on a radix tree using a radix of two, so
 sometimes you see patricia implementations called "radix" as
 well.  The term "Trie" is derived from the word "retrieval"
 but is pronounced like "try".  Patricia stands for
 "Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded as
 Alphanumeric", and was first suggested for routing table
 lookups by Van Jacobsen.  Patricia Trie performance
 characteristics are well-known as it has been employed for
 routing table lookups within the BSD kernel since the 4.3
 Reno release.

Package: libnet-smtp-ssl-perl
Description-md5: 878dc73994d66b0f60f21a051fb72bd0
Description-en: Perl module providing SSL support to Net::SMTP
 Net::SMTP::SSL implements the same API as Net::SMTP, but uses IO::Socket::SSL
 for its network operations. Due to the nature of Net::SMTP's new method, it is
 not overridden to make use of a default port for the SMTPS service. Perhaps
 future versions will be smart like that. Port 465 is usually what you want,
 and it's not a pain to specify that.

Package: libpath-iterator-rule-perl
Description-md5: 51400e8efab6c3cda78729f25bd10adf
Description-en: iterative, recursive file finder
 Path::Iterator::Rule iterates over files and directories to identify
 ones matching a user-defined set of rules.  The API is based heavily on
 File::Find::Rule, but with more explicit distinction between matching
 rules and options that influence how directories are searched.  A
 Path::Iterator::Rule object is a collection of rules (match criteria)
 with methods to add additional criteria.  Options that control
 directory traversal are given as arguments to the method that generates
 an iterator.
 .
 Here is a summary of features for comparison to other file finding
 modules:
  * provides many "helper" methods for specifying rules
  * offers (lazy) iterator and flattened list interfaces
  * custom rules implemented with callbacks
  * breadth-first (default) or pre- or post-order depth-first searching
  * follows symlinks (by default, but can be disabled)
  * directories visited only once (no infinite loop; can be disabled)
  * doesn't chdir during operation
  * provides an API for extensions
 .
 As a convenience, the PIR module is an empty subclass of this one that
 is less arduous to type for one-liners.

Description-en: protocol buffers C++ library
 Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for
 serializing structured data - similar to XML, but smaller, faster, and
 simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can
 use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
 data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
 You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs
 that are compiled against the "old" format.
 .
 Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and
 file formats.

Description-md5: febf47fd836991c5b22ad0c176b41e1b
Description-en: pthread stubs not provided by native libc, development files
 This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided
 in libc or otherwise available by default.  Libraries like libxcb rely
 on pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe when
 linked to libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when running
 single-threaded. libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on
 platforms which do not supply all the necessary pthread stubs.
 .
 On platforms which already supply all the necessary pthread stubs, this
 package ships only the pkg-config file pthread-stubs.pc, to allow
 libraries to unconditionally express a dependency on pthread-stubs and
 still obtain correct behavior.

Package: librole-tiny-perl
Description-md5: fe9c69a8e958a2d37cc15895cfa1bc6a
Description-en: Perl module for minimalist role composition
 Role::Tiny is a Perl module to do minimalist role composition. Role composition
 can be thought of as much more clever and meaningful multiple inheritance.
 .
 The basics of this implementation of roles is:
  * If a method is already defined on a class, that method will not be composed
    in from the role.
  * If a method that the role "requires" to be implemented is not implemented,
    role application will fail loudly.
 .
 Unlike Class::C3, where the last class inherited from "wins," role composition
 is the other way around, where first wins. In a more complete system (see
 Moose) roles are checked to see if they clash. The goal of this is to be much
 simpler, hence disallowing composition of multiple roles at once.

Package: libsub-exporter-perl
Description-md5: 831312c784e01c10890ab7865252448f
Description-en: sophisticated exporter for custom-built routines
 When you use a perl module, first it is "required" function used, then its
 import method is called.
 .
 Sub::Exporter provides a sophisticated alternative to Exporter.pm.  It allows
 for renaming, currying/sub-generation etc.
 .
 Sub::Exporter builds a custom exporter which can then be installed into your
 module. It builds this method based on configuration passed to its
 setup_exporter method.

Package: libsub-exporter-progressive-perl
Description-md5: 854d6f3825a72a536574faf14f5c2cdf
Description-en: module for using Sub::Exporter only if needed
 Sub::Exporter is an incredibly powerful module, but with that power comes
 great responsibility, as well as some runtime penalties.
 Sub::Exporter::Progressive is a Sub::Exporter wrapper that will let your
 users just use Exporter if all they are doing is picking exports, but use
 Sub::Exporter if your users try to use Sub::Exporter's more advanced
 features, like renaming exports.
 .
 Note that this module will export @EXPORT and @EXPORT_OK package variables
 for Exporter to work. Additionally, if your package uses advanced
 Sub::Exporter features like currying, this module will only use
 Sub::Exporter, so you might as well use it directly.

Package: libsub-identify-perl
Description-md5: 9b4d49af75c72bb6e04434d783ca36ff
Description-en: module to retrieve names of code references
 Sub::Identify allows you to retrieve the real name of code references. For
 this, it uses perl's introspection mechanism, provided by the B module.
 .
 It provides four functions : sub_name returns the name of the
 subroutine (or __ANON__ if it's an anonymous code reference),
 stash_name returns its package, and sub_fullname returns the
 concatenation of the two.
 .
 The fourth function, get_code_info, returns a list of two elements,
 the package and the subroutine name (in case of you want both and are worried
 by the speed.)
 .
 In case of subroutine aliasing, those functions always return the
 original name.

Description-en: module for assigning a new name to referenced sub
 Sub::Name has only one function, which is also exported by default:
 .
 subname NAME, CODEREF
 .
 Assigns a new name to referenced sub. If package specification is
 omitted in the name, then the current package is used. The return
 value is the sub.
 .
 The name is only used for informative routines (caller, Carp, etc).
 You won't be able to actually invoke the sub by the given name. To
 allow that, you need to do glob-assignment yourself.

Package: libsub-quote-perl
Description-md5: 6fd03f4739a290c567bd57f23e0f26ae

 most common version, as version 6 is considered deprecated, and version
 8, which adds Xprint support, is unsupported and not widely used.
 In general, use of a more modern toolkit such as GTK+ is recommended.
 .
 This package contains the debug versions of the library found in libxaw7.
 Non-developers likely have little use for this package.

 number of basic checks.

Package: libxml-parser-perl
Description-md5: 1d62424e8724202d89f9a9fadad8266e
Description-en: Perl module for parsing XML files
 The XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's
 expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance
 of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document. Expat options
 may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created. These options are
 then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call. They can also be given
 as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or Handlers
 options, or by setHandlers method. These all provide mechanisms for
 XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat. If neither
 Style nor Handlers are specified, then parsing just checks the document for
 being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first parameter
 the Expat object, not the Parser object.

Package: libxml-sax-base-perl
Description-md5: d2b9fd04fe2bfb32b35febb80f2cfc34
Description-en: base class for SAX drivers and filters
 XML::SAX::Base is a base class for PerlSAX drivers and filters.  The main
 advantages that it provides are easy dispatching of events the right way (ie
 it takes care for you of checking that the handler has implemented that
 method, or has defined an AUTOLOAD), and the guarantee that filters will pass
 along events that they aren't implementing to handlers downstream that might
 nevertheless be interested in them.
 .
 This package also provides XML::SAX::Exception.

Package: libxml-sax-expat-perl
Description-md5: b242c9d25492331b246160ca4a019e9d
Description-en: Perl module for a SAX2 driver for Expat (XML::Parser)
 This module is an implementation of a SAX2 driver sitting on top of
 Expat (XML::Parser).  It is still incomplete, though most of the
 basic SAX2 events should be available.

Package: libxml-sax-perl
Description-md5: 85b6ca7554a3537b49500d73d818d9b6
Description-en: Perl module for using and building Perl SAX2 XML processors
 XML::SAX consists of several framework classes for using and
 building Perl SAX2 XML parsers, filters, and drivers.  It is designed
 around the need to be able to "plug in" different SAX parsers to an
 application without requiring programmer intervention.  Those of you
 familiar with the DBI will be right at home.  Some of the designs
 come from the Java JAXP specification (SAX part), only without the
 javaness.
 .
 The package also contains a SAX parser, XML::SAX::PurePerl, but it
 is considered too slow for serious use and is only provided as a
 fallback parser. It is recommend XML::SAX::Expat (provided in
 libxml-sax-expat-perl) instead.
 .
 The framework includes a Debian-specific script (called
 update-perl-sax-parsers) to manage the ParserDetails.ini file. This
 script is intended to be used in postinst and prerm package scripts to
 (de)register parsers.  See README.Debian for more info.

Package: libxml-simple-perl
Description-md5: 9205d4b838f0b9ba0b4731da4e97a76d
Description-en: Perl module for reading and writing XML
 The XML::Simple module provides a simple API layer on top of an underlying
 XML parsing module to maintain XML files (especially configuration
 files).  Two functions are exported: XMLin() and XMLout().
 .
 The simplest approach is to call these two functions directly, but an
 optional object oriented interface allows them to be called as
 methods of an XML::Simple object.  The object interface can also be
 used at either end of a SAX pipeline.

Package: libxml-twig-perl
Description-md5: 57b0c694882ee9f6f587f4f1a19451b2
Description-en: Perl module for processing huge XML documents in tree mode
 This module provides a way to process XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser.
 .
 The module offers a tree interface to the document, while allowing to
 output the parts of it that have been completely processed.
 .
 It allows minimal resource (CPU and memory) usage by building the
 tree only for the parts of the documents that need actual processing,
 through the use of the twig_roots and twig_print_outside_roots
 options.  The finish and finish_print methods also help to increase
 performance.
 .
 XML::Twig tries to make simple things easy so it tries its best to
 takes care of a lot of the (usually) annoying (but sometimes
 necessary) features that come with XML and XML::Parser.

Package: libxml-xpathengine-perl
Description-md5: a232570871d958cf3696105e6607e9a0
Description-en: re-usable XPath engine for DOM-like trees
 XML::XPathEngine provides an XPath engine, that can be re-used by other
 module/classes that implement trees.
 .
 In order to use the XPath engine, nodes in the user module need to mimic
 DOM nodes. The degree of similarity between the user tree and a DOM dictates
 how much of the XPath features can be used. A module implementing all of the
 DOM should be able to use this module very easily (you might need to add
 the cmp method on nodes in order to get ordered result sets).
 .
 This module is derived from Matt Sergeant's XML::XPath.

Description-en: Perl interface to libyaml, a YAML implementation
 YAML::LibYAML (or YAML::XS) is a Perl interface to Kirill Siminov's libyaml
 library, a YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML) implementation written in C to
 support the YAML 1.1 specification. The provided Dump and Load routines
 are compatible with the Perl YAML module (see libyaml-perl).

Package: libyaml-perl
Description-md5: 207c6e42686e3356a6c6e3a975e92075
Description-en: YAML Ain't Markup Language
 YAML is a generic data serialization language that is optimized for human
 readability. It can be used to express the data structures of most modern
 programming languages (including Perl, of course). YAML supports Unicode
 and there are implementations of the parser in many different languages,
 making it a rather portable serialization format.
 .
 Please note that the YAML module is currently a deprecated implementation
 in Pure Perl, which is probably slow on your system. The authors intend
 to change it to just be a front-end interface module for various YAML
 implementations. For now, YAML::Any is a module provided for this purpose,
 which simply selects the best YAML implementation available.

 Project.

Package: llvm-3.9
Description-md5: e971ae25bca86cd8f4914ecf62f6301c
Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X86, SparcV9, PowerPC or many other architectures.

Description-md5: 61fee537b751bf39ce1ac5bf27ca3806
Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies, examples
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 This package contains examples for using LLVM, both in developing
 extensions to LLVM and in using it to compile code.

 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X86, SparcV9, PowerPC or many other architectures.

 login program invokes your user shell and enables command execution. The
 newgrp program is used to change your effective group ID (useful for
 workgroup type situations). The su program allows changing your effective
 user ID (useful being able to execute commands as another user).

Package: logrotate
Description-md5: bb73169bb75b2b8a2fda1453d214416d
Description-en: Log rotation utility
 The logrotate utility is designed to simplify the administration of
 log files on a system which generates a lot of log files.  Logrotate
 allows for the automatic rotation compression, removal and mailing of
 log files.  Logrotate can be set to handle a log file daily, weekly,
 monthly or when the log file gets to a certain size.  Normally, logrotate
 runs as a daily cron job.

Package: logtail
Description-md5: d3d40f9e26c6029e962576fe56693f04
Description-en: Print log file lines that have not been read
 This program will read in a standard text file and create an
 offset marker when it reads the end. The offset marker is read
 the next time logtail is run and the text file pointer is moved
 to the offset location. This allows logtail to read in the next
 lines of data following the marker. This is good for marking log
 files for automatic log file checkers to monitor system events.
 .
 The package also provides logtail2, which better deals with rotated log
 files: If logtail2 finds that the inode of the file was changed, it assumes
 that the log has been rotated, and tries to find the file it was rotated to
 using heuristic plugins. If it finds the file, it will print the remainder of
 the file starting at the offset saved to the offset file. If a file with the
 correct inode was not found, logtail2 will only print the new file in its
 entirety before writing a new offset file.

Package: logwatch
Description-md5: ece539a8a87c5f861d7f0b865e42a03c
Description-en: log analyser with nice output written in Perl
 Logwatch is a modular log analyser that runs every night
 and mails you the results. It can also be run from command line.
 .
 The output is by service and you can limit the output to one particular
 service. The subscripts which are responsible for the output, mostly
 convert the raw log lines in structured format.
 .
 Logwatch generally ignores the time component in the output, that means,
 you will know that the reported event was logged in the requested range of
 time, but you will have to go to the raw log files to get the exact details.

Package: lp-solve
Description-md5: 0cf1973d14c9916f985920235dcabc27
Description-en: Solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems
 The linear programming (LP) problem can be formulated as: Solve A.x >=
 V1, with V2.x maximal. A is a matrix, x is a vector of (nonnegative)
 variables, V1 is a vector called the right hand side, and V2 is a vector
 specifying the objective function.
 .
 An integer linear programming (ILP) problem is an LP with the
 constraint that all the variables are integers.  In a mixed integer
 linear programming (MILP) problem, some of the variables are integer
 and others are real.
 .
 The program lp_solve solves LP, ILP, and MILP problems. It is slightly
 more general than suggested above, in that every row of A (specifying
 one constraint) can have its own (in)equality, <=, >= or =. The result
 specifies values for all variables.
 .
 lp_solve uses the 'Simplex' algorithm and sparse matrix methods for
 pure LP problems.  If one or more of the variables is declared
 integer, the Simplex algorithm is iterated with a branch and bound
 algorithm, until the desired optimal solution is found.  lp_solve can
 read MPS format input files.

 exits.  While the command is executing, ltrace intercepts and records
 the dynamic library calls which are called by
 the executed process and the signals received by that process.
 It can also intercept and print the system calls executed by the program.
 .
 The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can
 use it on binaries for which you don't have the source handy.
 .
 You should install ltrace if you need a sysadmin tool for tracking the
 execution of processes.

 MAAS runs a software-defined data centre - it turns a collection of physical
 servers and switches into a bare metal cloud with full open source IP address
 management (IPAM) and instant provisioning on demand.
 .
 MAAS controls the servers through IPMI or another BMC or  converged chassis
 controller such as Cisco UCS. It provides a full inventory  of components,
 and can install Ubuntu, CentOS or Windows very fast on any  server under
 its control. It can also track and provide DHCP and DNS for other devices
 on the network.
 .
 MAAS handles VLANs and fabrics that span many trunked switches, as well as
 the routing-centric infrastructure typically used for large-scale OpenStack
 or other scale-out deployments. MAAS manages IP addresses and provides APIs
 for address assignment and release. MAAS can also allocate IP addresses for
 containers on machines, and release them when the machine is repurposed. MAAS
 provides PXE, DHCP, DNS and other low-level  services to ensure the cluster
 works smoothly.
 .
 MAAS works with any configuration system, and is recommended by the teams
 behind both Chef and Juju as a physical provisioning system.
 .
 MAAS provides:
 .
  * Hardware inventory of servers
  * Dynamic provisioning based on name or attributes such as disk, RAM, cores,
    nics, networking, gpu’s or architecture
  * DNS and DHCP as needed
  * PXE boot services

 GNU Make is a utility which controls the generation of executables
 and other target files of a program from the program's source
 files. It determines automatically which pieces of a large program
 need to be (re)created, and issues the commands to (re)create
 them. Make can be used to organize any task in which targets (files)
 are to be automatically updated based on input files whenever the
 corresponding input is newer --- it is not limited to building
 computer programs. Indeed, Make is a general purpose dependency
 solver.

 Danga Interactive developed memcached to enhance the speed of LiveJournal.com,
 a site which was already doing 20 million+ dynamic page views per day for 1
 million users with a bunch of webservers and a bunch of database servers.
 memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing, yielding faster page
 load times for users, better resource utilization, and faster access to the
 databases on a memcache miss.
 .
 memcached optimizes specific high-load serving applications that are designed
 to take advantage of its versatile no-locking memory access system. Clients
 are available in several different programming languages, to suit the needs
 of the specific application. Traditionally this has been used in mod_perl
 apps to avoid storing large chunks of data in Apache memory, and to share
 this burden across several machines.

 boot-up, so that it can test *all* of your memory.  You may want to
 look at `memtester', which allows to test your memory within Linux,
 but this one won't be able to test your whole RAM.
 .
 It can output a list of bad RAM regions usable by the BadRAM kernel
 patch, so that you can still use your old RAM with one or two bad bits.
 .
 Memtest86+ is based on memtest86 3.0, and adds support for recent
 hardware, as well as a number of general-purpose improvements,
 including many patches to memtest86 available from various sources.
 .
 Both memtest86 and memtest86+ are being worked on in parallel.

Package: mlocate
Description-md5: 34e9c00f37885dbcdfb61296f24c84df
Description-en: quickly find files on the filesystem based on their name
 mlocate is a new implementation of locate, a tool to find files
 anywhere in the filesystem based on their name, using a fixed pattern
 or a regular expression. Unlike other tools like find(1), locate uses
 a previously created database to perform the search, allowing queries
 to execute much faster. This database is updated periodically from
 cron.
 .
 Several implementations of locate exist: the original implementation
 from GNU's findutils, slocate, and mlocate. The advantages of mlocate
 are:
 .
  * it indexes all the filesystem, but results of a search will only
    include files that the user running locate has access to. It does
    this by updating the database as root, but making it unreadable for
    normal users, who can only access it via the locate binary. slocate
    does this as well, but not the original locate.
 .
  * instead of re-reading all the contents of all directories each time
    the database is updated, mlocate keeps timestamp information in its
    database and can know if the contents of a directory changed without
    reading them again. This makes updates much faster and less demanding
    on the hard drive. This feature is only found in mlocate.
 .
 Installing mlocate will change the /usr/bin/locate binary to point to
 mlocate via the alternatives mechanism. After installation, you may
 wish to run /etc/cron.daily/mlocate by hand to create the database,
 otherwise mlocate won't work until that script is run from cron itself
 (since mlocate does not use the same database file as standard locate).
 Also, you may wish to remove the "locate" package in order not to have
 two different database files updated regularly on your system.

Package: packagekit
Description-md5: 2a370c6f43c72ec3adb4412d3b3bdca0
Description-en: Provides a package management service
 PackageKit allows performing simple software management tasks over a DBus
 interface e.g. refreshing the cache, updating, installing and removing
 software packages or searching for multimedia codecs and file handlers.
 .
 The work is done by backends which make use of the package manager shipped by
 the corresponding distribution. PackageKit is not meant to replace
 advanced tools like Synaptic.
 .
 The main benefits are:
  - unified interface on several distributions
  - fine grained privileges by using PolicyKit
  - independency from a running desktop session during the processing

 This package contains the binary and manual page. Further
 documentation is available in parted-doc.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS, and PC98
 partitioning formats, as well as a "loop" (raw disk) type which
 allows use on RAID/LVM. It can detect and remove ASFS/AFFS/APFS,
 Btrfs, ext2/3/4, FAT16/32, HFS, JFS, linux-swap, UFS, XFS, and ZFS
 file systems. Parted also has the ability to create and modify file
 systems of some of these types, but using it to perform file system
 operations is now deprecated.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive
 data loss. While there are no such bugs known at the moment, they
 could exist, so please back up all important files before running
 it, and do so at your own risk.

Package: pax
Description-md5: 7f236f6351e1536c2153e84c93563932
Description-en: Portable Archive Interchange (cpio, pax, tar)
 paxtar is an implementation of an archiving utility that reads
 and writes several formats - traditional ones, the extended
 formats specified in IEEE 1003.1, and the ar(5) format used
 by deb(5) packages (MirBSD specific paxtar extension). The
 pax interface was designed by IEEE 1003.2 as a compromise in
 the chronic controversy over which of tar or cpio is best, but
 this implementation offers paxcpio and paxtar for easy calling.
 .
 This is the MirBSD paxtar implementation supporting the formats
 ar, bcpio, cpio, SVR4 cpio with and without CRC, old tar, and
 ustar, but not the format known as pax yet. It has extensions
 for removing non-numerical user and group IDs from the archive,
 storing hardlinked files only once, setting ownership to the
 superuser, anonymising inode and device information, changing
 the mtime to zero, and producing GNU tar compatible trailing
 slashes on ustar directory nodes. Its "ar" format is suitable
 for operating on *.deb files, unlike that of GNU binutils.
 .
 Note that ACLs and Extended Attributes are not supported.
 Also, on Debian GNU/Hurd and Debian GNU/Linux (but not
 Debian GNU/kFreeBSD), size of archive members is limited
 to the width of the "long" type, that is, 2 GiB on platforms
 that do not have a 64-bit "long" type, due to a bug in the
 GNU C library (Debian #317466).

Package: pbuilder
Description-md5: a8198b8566f5ca30b1c95b4df04af8ce
Description-en: personal package builder for Debian packages
 pbuilder constructs a chroot system, and builds a package inside the
 chroot.
 It is an ideal system to use to check
 that a package has correct build-dependencies.
 It uses apt extensively, and a local mirror, or a fast connection
 to a Debian mirror is ideal, but not necessary.
 .
 "pbuilder create" uses debootstrap to create a chroot image.
 .
 "pbuilder update" updates the image to the current state of
 testing/unstable/whatever
 .
 "pbuilder build" takes a *.dsc file and builds a binary in the chroot
 image.
 .
 pdebuild is a wrapper for Debian Developers, to allow running
 pbuilder just like "debuild", as a normal user.

 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

 Architecture independent Perl modules.  These modules are part of Perl and
 required if the `perl' package is installed.
 .
 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be
 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.
 Other packages should not depend on `perl-modules-5.26' directly, they
 should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules-5.26') instead.

Package: perl-openssl-defaults

Description-en: version compatibility baseline for Perl OpenSSL packages
 A subset of Perl XS module packages expose the OpenSSL binary interface
 to Perl code. This can lead to incompatibilities if these packages are
 linked against different versions of OpenSSL.
 .
 This package provides a virtual package "perl-openssl-abi-x" that
 corresponds to the libssl-dev package SONAME it was built against.
 The packages that need to stay compatible with each other can depend
 on this.
 .
 Tools are also provided for generating this dependency with minimum
 hassle. See the instructions in README.Debian.

Description-md5: 40c3b46e5e326523fcd237c6508519bf
Description-en: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users
 working in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling
 packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If
 you install any of the graphical packages then this package is not
 necessary because the sibling packages automatically fall back to
 text mode if X is not active.

 pkgbinarymangler consists of a dpkg-deb wrapper that calls the following
 helper applications while building a debian binary package:
 .
 pkgstriptranslations removes all *.mo files in /usr/share/locale from
 all package build directories. It is used to strip off gettext translations
 from generated binary packages, because translations are already shipped
 in the language packs.  Its behaviour (which is disabled by default) is
 configured in /etc/pkgbinarymangler/striptranslations.conf.
 .
 pkgmaintainermangler adjusts the maintainer field in binary packages to
 match a set of rules (including whitelists, mass renames by component,
 maintainer name, etc) defined in the pkgmaintainermangler configuration
 file at /etc/pkgbinarymangler/maintainermangler.conf.

Package: plainbox-secure-policy
Description-md5: 2095659d86953fc3b64eebbc928f176d
Description-en: policykit policy required to use plainbox (secure version)
 PlainBox is a toolkit consisting of python3 library, development tools,
 documentation and examples. It is targeted at developers working on testing or
 certification applications and authors creating tests for such applications.
 .
 PlainBox can be used to both create simple and comprehensive test tools as
 well as to develop and execute test jobs and test scenarios. It was created as
 a refined and rewritten core of the Checkbox project. It has a well tested and
 documented core, small but active development community and a collection of
 associated projects that use it as a lower-level engine/back-end library.
 .
 PlainBox has a novel approach to discovering (and probing) hardware and
 software that is extensible and not hardwired into the system. It allows test
 developers to express association between a particular test and the hardware,
 software and configuration constraints that must be met for the test to
 execute meaningfully. This feature, along with pluggable test definitions,
 makes plainbox flexible and applicable to many diverse testing situations,
 ranging from mobile phones, traditional desktop computers, servers and up to
 testing "cloud" installations.
 .
 This package contains a PolicyKit .policy file that allows PlainBox to run
 plainbox-trusted-launcher-1 as root and ask for the user password only once
 per session.

Description-en: authentication agent for PolicyKit
 PolicyKit-gnome provides a D-Bus session bus service that is used to
 bring up authentication dialogs used for obtaining privileges.
 .
 This implementation was originally designed for GNOME 2, but most
 GNOME-based desktop environments, including GNOME 3, GNOME Flashback,
 and MATE, have their own built-in PolicyKit agents and no longer use
 this one. The remaining users of this implementation are Cinnamon, XFCE
 and Unity.

Package: policykit-desktop-privileges
Description-md5: 6e3460016ae1ccb86bf669462d180f6f
Description-en: run common desktop actions without password
 This package provides a set of PolicyKit privileges which allow Administrators
 to run common actions without being asked for their password:
 .
  * mounting and checking internal disk drives (through udisks)
  * setting the CPU speed and policy (through the GNOME CPU frequency applet)
  * setting the time and timezone (through the GNOME clock applet or through
    KDE)
  * Adding/changing system-wide NetworkManager connections
  * Update already installed software
  * Configure printers
 .
 It does not change privileges for non-Administrators (users who are not in the
 "admin" or "sudo" group). So this satisfies the typical desktop/laptop use
 case where the user has full control over the hardware anyway.
 .
 This is implemented by shipping a pklocalauthority(8) file.

Package: policyrcd-script-zg2
Description-md5: 7d7c7ded8bc05abbd5e2982614b87ac3
Description-en: policy-compliant interface from invoke-rc.d to local config files
 This package contains a script which is linked via the alternatives
 subsystem to /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d. This script looks for a local
 policy-rc.d script in /usr/local and /etc, providing a policy- and
 FHS-compliant way to interface invoke-rc.d with a local script.
 .
 Without this package, a local admin wanting to cleanly interface with
 invoke-rc.d is forced to drop a local binary to /usr/sbin and/or
 manually interface with the alternatives system. Both ways of doing
 this are clumsy and error-prone, so this package offers a clean way of
 interfacing with sysvrc and file-rc.
 .
 Since there are at least two packages containing their own version of
 invoke-rc.d, having a search path policy for policy-rc.d can be
 messy and is prone to be unstructured and uncoordinated.
 .
 Hence, having a dedicated package is the clean way of doing things.
 .
 This package has its upstream sources maintained in the Debian
 project, so there is no upstream URL.

Package: pollinate

Description-en: seed the pseudo random number generator
 This client will connect to one or more Pollen (entropy-as-a-service)
 servers over an (optionally) encrypted connection and retrieve a random
 seed over HTTP or HTTPS.
 This is particularly useful at the first boot of cloud images and in
 virtual machines, to seed a system's random number generator at
 genesis, and is intended to supplement the /etc/init.d/urandom init script.
 It can be used on physical machines, as well, to supplement the seeding
 of the pseudo random number generator.

  * Support for timeouts.
  * Channels are restored after channel error, instead of having to close the
    connection.
  * Support for heartbeats.
  * Supports RabbitMQ extensions:
    - Consumer Cancel Notifications.
    - Publisher confirms.
    - Exchange-to-exchange bindings: exchange_bind / exchange_unbind.
  * Support for basic_return.
  * Uses AMQP 0-9-1 instead of 0-8.
  * Exposes the underlying socket as Connection.sock.
  * Adds Channel.no_ack_consumers to keep track of consumer tags that set the
    no_ack flag.
  * Slightly better at error recovery.

 provides the foundation over which complex web-based applications can
 be written, with little or no knowledge of the underlying
 protocols. CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in
 much the same way they would build any other object-oriented Python
 program. This usually results in smaller source code developed in
 less time.
 .
 CherryPy is up-to-date with the latest developments on using Python
 for web development: it features a bundled WSGI server, and is able
 to integrate with other dispatching mechanisms, such as
 Routes. CherryPy can be run as a standalone application, since it
 provides its own HTTP server; setting it up behind another HTTP
 server, such as Apache, or even with mod_python are also options.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 module cherrypy.

Description-en: simplify usage of Python decorators by programmers
 Python 2.4 decorators have significantly changed the way Python programs are
 structured.
    * decorators help reduce boilerplate code;
    * decorators help the separation of concerns;
    * decorators enhance readability and maintainability;
    * decorators are very explicit.
 Still, as of now, writing custom decorators correctly requires some
 experience and is not as easy as it could be. For instance, typical
 implementations of decorators involve nested functions and we all know that
 flat is better than nested.
 The aim of the decorator module it to simplify the usage of decorators for
 the average programmer and to popularize decorators usage giving examples of
 useful decorators, such as memoize, tracing, redirecting_stdout, locked, etc.

Package: python-deprecation
Description-md5: 612c74aa0ea9f42fcfbbe4b31fe5df25
Description-en: A library to handle automated deprecations
 The deprecation library provides a deprecated decorator and a
 fail_if_not_removed decorator for your tests. Together, the two
 enable the automation of several things:
 .
  1. The docstring of a deprecated method gets the deprecation details
     appended to the end of it. If you generate your API docs direct
     from your source, you don't need to worry about writing your own
     notification. You also don't need to worry about forgetting to
     write it. It's done for you.
  2. Rather than having code live on forever because you only deprecated
     it but never actually moved on from it, you can have your tests
     tell you when it's time to remove the code. The '@deprecated'
     decorator can be told when it's time to entirely remove the code,
     which causes '@fail_if_not_removed' to raise an 'AssertionError',
     causing either your unittest or py.test tests to fail.
 .

Package: python-egenix-mxdatetime
Description-md5: e3102cb577c19b97097313b6b22ad8ea
Description-en: date and time handling routines for Python
 mxDateTime is a Python extension package that provides three new
 objects, DateTime, DateTimeDelta and RelativeDateTime, which let you
 store and handle date/time values in a much more natural way than by
 using ticks (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), the representation
 used by Python's time module).
 .
 You can add, subtract and even multiply instances, pickle and copy
 them and convert the results to strings, COM dates, ticks and some
 other more esoteric values. In addition, there are several convenient
 constructors and formatters at hand to greatly simplify dealing with
 dates and times in real-world applications.
 .
 In addition to providing an easy-to-use Python interface the package
 also exports a comfortable C API interface for other extensions to
 build upon. This is especially interesting for database applications
 which often have to deal with date/time values (the mxODBC package is
 one example of an extension using this interface).
 .
 mxDateTime can convert between various different date/time storage
 formats, including COM dates, TJD, MJD, JDN, tuples and, probably
 most important, strings.
 .
 The date/time parser included in mxDateTime is one of the most
 flexible such parser available for Python. It is constantly being
 improved to make parsing date/time strings as easy as possible. At
 the same time, it offers a fully customizable interface which allows
 selecting valid date/time formats from a range of predefined
 categories.
 .
 There are also special parser and formatter modules for ARPA and ISO
 date/time formats, which are handy if you work a lot with Internet
 standards.

    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] with a method to perform partial
 modifications to resources.
 .
 JSON Patch is a format (identified by the media type "application/
 json-patch") for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a target JSON
 document, suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method.

 language implementation, meaning the JSONPath expressions are first class
 objects, easy to analyze, transform, parse, print, and extend.
 .
 The JSONPath syntax supported by this library includes some additional
 features and omits some problematic features (those that make it unportable).
 In particular, some new operators such as "|" and "where" are available, and
 parentheses are used for grouping not for callbacks into Python, since with
 these changes the language is not trivially associative. Also, fields may be
 quoted whether or not they are contained in brackets.

 Other back ends are possible with the same semantics. Examples
 included are:
  * ‘SQLiteLockFile’, using records in an SQLite database.
  * ‘PIDLockFile’, using the semantics of a Unix PID file.
 .
 Unlike other Python locking libraries (the Windows ‘msvcrt.locking’
 function, the Unix ‘fcntl.flock’, ‘fcntl.lockf’, and the deprecated
 ‘posixfile’ module), the API is identical across both Unix (including
 GNU/Linux and MacOS) and Windows platforms.

Description-en: inject useful and sensible default behaviors into setuptools - Python 2.x
 PBR (Python Build Reasonableness) is a library that injects some useful and
 sensible default behaviors into your setuptools run. PBR can:
  * Manage version number based on git revisions and tags (Version file).
  * Generate AUTHORS file from git log
  * Generate ChangeLog from git log
  * Generate Sphinx autodoc stub files for your whole module
  * Store your dependencies in a pip requirements file
  * Use your README file as a long_description
  * Smartly find packages under your root package
 .
 PBR is only mildly configurable. The basic idea is that there's a decent way
 to run things and if you do, you should reap the rewards, because then it's
 simple and repeatable. If you want to do things differently, cool! But you've
 already got the power of Python at your fingertips, so you don't really need
 PBR.

 PBR builds on top of the work that d2to1 started to provide for declarative
 configuration. d2to1 is itself an implementation of the ideas behind
 distutils2. Although distutils2 is now abandoned in favor of work towards PEP
 426 and Metadata 2.0, declarative config is still a great idea and
 specifically important in trying to distribute setup code as a library when
 that library itself will alter how the setup is processed. As Metadata 2.0 and
 other modern Python packaging PEPs come out, PBR aims to support them as
 quickly as possible.

 frameworks to automatically discover plugins.  It also provides
 runtime support for using C extensions that are inside zipfile-format
 eggs, support for merging packages that have separately-distributed
 modules or subpackages, and APIs for managing Python's current
 "working set" of active packages.

Package: python-ply
Description-md5: ddbdacd0971bf7aaecde3faf56c83ece
Description-en: Lex and Yacc implementation for Python2
 PLY   is   yet  another   implementation   of   lex   and  yacc   for
 Python.  Although  several  other  parsing tools  are  available  for
 Python, there are  several reasons why you might want  to take a look
 at PLY:
  * It's implemented entirely in Python.
  * It uses  LR-parsing which is reasonably efficient  and well suited
    for larger grammars.
  * PLY  provides most  of  the standard  lex/yacc features  including
    support for  empty productions, precedence  rules, error recovery,
    and support for ambiguous grammars.
  * PLY is  extremely easy  to use and  provides very  extensive error
    checking.

 (just like pygresql and popy.) This is version 2, a complete rewrite of the
 original code to provide new-style classes for connection and cursor objects
 and other sweet candies. Like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the
 aim of being very small and fast, and stable as a rock.
 .
 psycopg is different from the other database adapter because it was designed
 for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy lots of
 cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs.
 psycopg 2 also provides full asynchronous operations for the really brave
 programmer.

     automatic generation of random nonces and IVs, simplified CTR cipher mode,
     and more)
   * SHA-3 (including SHAKE XOFs) and BLAKE2 hash algorithms
   * Salsa20 and ChaCha20 stream ciphers
   * scrypt and HKDF
   * Deterministic (EC)DSA
   * Password-protected PKCS#8 key containers

 CSS. The library acts as a CSS source code preprocesor which
 allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, and have
 inheritance of rules, all with a CSS-compatible syntax which
 the preprocessor then compiles to standard CSS.

Package: python-rjsmin
Description-md5: 269753e1e0282f58d34e1c851174de91
Description-en: javascript minifier written in Python - Python 2.7
 rJSmin is a javascript minifier written in Python. The minifier is based on
 the semantics of jsmin.c by Douglas Crockford.
 .
 The module is a re-implementation aiming for speed, so it can be used at
 runtime (rather than during a preprocessing step). Usually it produces the
 same results as the original jsmin.c. It differs in the following ways:
 .
  - there is no error detection: unterminated string, regex and comment
    literals are treated as regular javascript code and minified as such.
  - Control characters inside string and regex literals are left untouched; they
    are not converted to spaces (nor to)
  - Newline characters are not allowed inside string and regex literals, except
    for line continuations in string literals (ECMA-5).
  - "return /regex/" is recognized correctly.
  - Line terminators after regex literals are handled more sensibly
  - "+ +" and "- -" sequences are not collapsed to '++' or '--'
  - Newlines before ! operators are removed more sensibly
  - Comments starting with an exclamation mark (!) can be kept optionally
  - rJSmin does not handle streams, but only complete strings. (However, the
    module provides a "streamy" interface).
 .
 Since most parts of the logic are handled by the regex engine it's way faster
 than the original Python port of jsmin.c by Baruch Even. The speed factor
 varies between about 6 and 55 depending on input and Python version (it gets
 faster the more compressed the input already is).  Compared to the
 speed-refactored Python port by Dave St.Germain the performance gain is less
 dramatic but still between 3 and 50 (for huge inputs)). See the
 docs/BENCHMARKS file for details.

Package: python-sqlalchemy
Description-md5: 304b4f5d471b523d00f34c7c91faec22
Description-en: SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper for Python
 SQLAlchemy is an SQL database abstraction library for Python.
 Its strengths are:
  * full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite
    of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for
    efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
    and Pythonic domain language.
  * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing pooled
    connections, constructing SQL from Python expressions, finding object
    instances, and committing object modifications back to the database.
  * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph of
    objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
    structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
    arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together to
    load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single result set;
    commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
  * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap out
    generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind parameters
    for all literal values, fully transactionalized and consistent updates
    using Unit of Work.
  * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the
    rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and ORM. SQLAlchemy
    is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of customization, with
    an architecture that supports custom datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and
    ORM plugins which can augment or extend mapping functionality.

Description-en: distributed virtual object store - Python libraries
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides the Python libraries that actually implement
 everything.

Package: python-webencodings
Description-md5: 1d5a23901af10a86a7dd41bffdcecb35
Description-en: Python implementation of the WHATWG Encoding standard
 In order to be compatible with legacy web content when interpreting something
 like Content-Type: text/html; charset=latin1, tools need to use a particular
 set of aliases for encoding labels as well as some overriding rules.  For
 example, US-ASCII and iso-8859-1 on the web are actually aliases for
 windows-1252, and an UTF-8 or UTF-16 BOM takes precedence over any other
 encoding declaration.  The Encoding standard defines all such details so that
 implementations do not have to reverse-engineer each other.
 .
 This module has encoding labels and BOM detection, but the actual
 implementation for encoders and decoders is Python’s.
 .
 This package provides the module for Python 2.

 The aim of the wrapt module is to provide a transparent object proxy for
 Python, which can be used as the basis for the construction of function
 wrappers and decorator functions.
 .

 beyond existing mechanisms such as functools.wraps() to ensure that decorators
 preserve introspectability, signatures, type checking abilities etc. The
 decorators that can be constructed using this module will work in far more
 scenarios than typical decorators and provide more predictable and consistent
 behaviour.
 .
 To ensure that the overhead is as minimal as possible, a C extension module is
 used for performance critical components. An automatic fallback to a pure
 Python implementation is also provided where a target system does not have a
 compiler to allow the C extension to be compiled.

  * Objects that need to held circular references at each other, but at
    different stages. To instantiate object Foo you need an instance of Bar.
    Instance of Bar needs an instance of Foo in some of it methods (but not at
    construction).  Circular imports sound familiar?
 .

    to use but you don't want to pay for allocating all the resources at the
    start as you usually need just few of them.

 syntax which compiles into Python modules for maximum performance. Mako's
 syntax and API borrows from the best ideas of many others, including Django
 templates, Cheetah, Myghty, and Genshi. Conceptually, Mako is an embedded
 Python (i.e. Python Server Page) language, which refines the familiar ideas of
 componentized layout and inheritance to produce one of the most
 straightforward and flexible models available, while also maintaining close
 ties to Python calling and scoping semantics.

Description-en: inject useful and sensible default behaviors into setuptools - Python 3.x
 PBR (Python Build Reasonableness) is a library that injects some useful and
 sensible default behaviors into your setuptools run. PBR can:
  * Manage version number based on git revisions and tags (Version file).
  * Generate AUTHORS file from git log
  * Generate ChangeLog from git log
  * Generate Sphinx autodoc stub files for your whole module
  * Store your dependencies in a pip requirements file
  * Use your README file as a long_description
  * Smartly find packages under your root package
 .
 PBR is only mildly configurable. The basic idea is that there's a decent way
 to run things and if you do, you should reap the rewards, because then it's
 simple and repeatable. If you want to do things differently, cool! But you've
 already got the power of Python at your fingertips, so you don't really need
 PBR.
 .
 PBR builds on top of the work that d2to1 started to provide for declarative
 configuration. d2to1 is itself an implementation of the ideas behind
 distutils2. Although distutils2 is now abandoned in favor of work towards PEP
 426 and Metadata 2.0, declarative config is still a great idea and
 specifically important in trying to distribute setup code as a library when
 that library itself will alter how the setup is processed. As Metadata 2.0 and
 other modern Python packaging PEPs come out, PBR aims to support them as
 quickly as possible.
 .
 This package provides support for Python 3.x.

 Launch a subprocess in a pseudo terminal (pty), and interact with both
 the process and its pty.
 .
 Sometimes, piping stdin and stdout is not enough. There might be a password
 prompt that doesn't read from stdin, output that changes when it's going to
 a pipe rather than a terminal, or curses-style interfaces that rely on a
 terminal. If you need to automate these things, running the process in a
 pseudo terminal (pty) is the answer.

  * full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite
    of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for
    efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
    and Pythonic domain language.
  * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing pooled
    connections, constructing SQL from Python expressions, finding object
    instances, and committing object modifications back to the database.
  * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph of
    objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
    structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
    arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together to
    load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single result set;
    commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
  * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap out
    generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind parameters
    for all literal values, fully transactionalized and consistent updates
    using Unit of Work.
  * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the
    rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and ORM. SQLAlchemy
    is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of customization, with
    an architecture that supports custom datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and
    ORM plugins which can augment or extend mapping functionality.

Package: python3-webencodings
Description-md5: 09618375d1b6526315c1f9714467ff3f
Description-en: Python implementation of the WHATWG Encoding standard
 In order to be compatible with legacy web content when interpreting something
 like Content-Type: text/html; charset=latin1, tools need to use a particular
 set of aliases for encoding labels as well as some overriding rules.  For
 example, US-ASCII and iso-8859-1 on the web are actually aliases for
 windows-1252, and an UTF-8 or UTF-16 BOM takes precedence over any other
 encoding declaration.  The Encoding standard defines all such details so that
 implementations do not have to reverse-engineer each other.

Package: python3-wrapt
Description-md5: 1a3eaaec5ca5f27019b2bb71093169c4
Description-en: decorators, wrappers and monkey patching. - Python 3.x
 The aim of the wrapt module is to provide a transparent object proxy for
 Python, which can be used as the basis for the construction of function
 wrappers and decorator functions.
 .
 The wrapt module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goes way
 beyond existing mechanisms such as functools.wraps() to ensure that decorators
 preserve introspectability, signatures, type checking abilities etc. The
 decorators that can be constructed using this module will work in far more
 scenarios than typical decorators and provide more predictable and consistent
 behaviour.
 .
 To ensure that the overhead is as minimal as possible, a C extension module is
 used for performance critical components. An automatic fallback to a pure
 Python implementation is also provided where a target system does not have a
 compiler to allow the C extension to be compiled.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x module.

Description-en: Tool for building Debian binary packages from Debian sources
 The sbuild suite of programs (buildd and sbuild) are used to build
 binary packages from source packages.  sbuild does the actual package
 building.
 .
 sbuild uses chroots to build packages, which act as virtual, minimal
 operating system installations dedicated to package building.  This
 means that a number of environments may be used for building
 simultaneously on the same machines, for example stable, testing,
 unstable and experimental.  When coupled with schroot to create
 snapshots of chroots, sbuild may be used to build many packages in
 parallel.  A chroot environment allows packages to be built in a
 controlled, clean environment.  sbuild installs only essential and
 build-essential packages, plus those in the package build
 dependencies.

Description-md5: 1d09f5907fa9b9f0626b53bc7ffd21a4
Description-en: Execute commands in a chroot environment
 schroot allows users to execute commands or interactive shells in
 different chroots.  Any number of named chroots may be created, and
 access permissions given to each, including root access for normal
 users, on a per-user or per-group basis.  Additionally, schroot can
 switch to a different user in the chroot, using PAM for
 authentication and authorisation.  All operations are logged for
 security.
 .
 Several different types of chroot are supported, including normal
 directories in the filesystem, and also block devices.  Sessions,
 persistent chroots created on the fly from files (tar with optional
 compression) and Btrfs and LVM snapshots are also supported.
 .
 schroot supports kernel personalities, allowing the programs run
 inside the chroot to have a different personality.  For example,
 running 32-bit chroots on 64-bit systems, or even running binaries
 from alternative operating systems such as SVR4 or Xenix.
 .
 schroot also integrates with sbuild, to allow building packages with
 all supported chroot types, including session-managed chroot types
 such as Btrfs and LVM snapshots.
 .
 schroot shares most of its options with dchroot, but offers vastly
 more functionality.

Description-en: distributed virtual object store - account server
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides the swift account server.

Package: t1utils
Description-md5: abf1d47b8ca1b485d148651358fc9283
Description-en: Collection of simple Type 1 font manipulation programs
 The t1utils tools allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB
 (binary) formats; disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable
 form; and reassemble the human-readable files into PFA or PFB format
 files.  You can also  extract font resources from a Macintosh font
 file (ATM/Laserwriter), or create a Macintosh Type 1 font file from a
 PFA or PFB font.
 .
 There are currently six programs:
 .
  t1ascii   Converts PFB files to PFA format.
 .
  t1binary  Converts PFA files to PFB format.
 .
  t1disasm  Disassembles a Type 1 font (PFA or PFB format) into a raw,
            human-readable text form for subsequent hand editing,
            tweaking, hint fixing, etcetera...
 .
  t1asm     Assembles a Type 1 font into PFA or PFB format from
            the human-readable form produced by t1disasm.
 .
  t1unmac   Extracts POST resources from a Macintosh Type 1 font file
            (ATM/Laserwriter) into PFA or PFB format for use outside
            the Macintosh environment.  The Macintosh file should be
            stored in MacBinary, AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex
            format, or as a raw resource fork.  Note that t1unmac does
            not have to run on a Macintosh, but makes Macintosh Type 1
            fonts available for use on Unix machines and PCs.
 .
  t1mac     Creates a Macintosh Type 1 file from a PFA- or PFB-format
            Type 1 font. Writes the Macintosh file in MacBinary,
            AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex format, or as a raw
            resource fork.  WARNING: This tool will not suffice to
            allow you to use the new font on a Macintosh, as
            Macintoshes cannot read raw Type 1 fonts.  You will need
            to create a font suitcase containing bitmap fonts.  If you
            do not already have such a suitcase for the font, T1utils
            will not help you create one.

 The telnet command is used for interactive communication with another host
 using the TELNET protocol.
 .
 For the purpose of remote login, the present client executable should be
 depreciated in favour of an ssh-client, or in some cases with variants like
 telnet-ssl or Kerberized TELNET clients.  The most important reason is that
 this implementation exchanges user name and password in clear text.
 .
 On the other hand, the present program does satisfy common use cases of
 network diagnostics, like protocol testing of SMTP services, so it can
 become handy enough.

 This contains four fonts: "Unifont", "Unifont Upper", "Unifont CSUR",
 and "Unifont Sample".
 .
 unifont.ttf is a bitmap font converted into a scalable TrueType
 outline font, Unifont.  Each pixel in the original bitmap font
 is represented as an outlined square.  The font provides a glyph
 for each visible code point (character) in the Unicode Basic
 Multilingual Plane (BMP, or Plane 0).  The BMP contains most of
 the world's modern writing scripts.  This font looks best at 12pt.
 .
 unifont_upper.ttf is a bitmap font converted into a scalable TrueType
 outline font that covers Unicode ranges above Plane 0.  Most of its
 glyphs are in Plane 1, the Unicode Supplemental Multilingual Plane (SMP).
 .
 unifont_csur.ttf is a bitmap font converted into a scalable TrueType
 outline font that contains some scripts in the ConScript Unicode
 Registry (CSUR).  These scripts are not part of the Unicode Standard,
 but are a popular use for the Private Use Area (PUA).  This font
 contains glyphs in Plane 0 and in the higher PUA planes.
 .
 unifont_sample.ttf is an SBIT font that contains combining circles
 and is therefore suitable for illustrating individual Unicode glyphs.
 The other font files do not contain combining circles and so are suitable
 for general-purpose writing.
 .
 Complex fonts (such as Indic or Semitic scripts, where letters change
 shape depending on their position in a word, or such as Mongolian, which
 can be written vertically) will not render perfectly.  The philosophy
 behind this font, though, is that anything meaningful is better than
 an empty box for an unknown glyph.

Description-md5: 83e3ff2859524c831253d938da348878
Description-en: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Package: usb-modeswitch
Description-md5: bbddadcef95b9342b7cf75c7d1b5cfa2
Description-en: mode switching tool for controlling "flip flop" USB devices
 Several new USB devices have their proprietary Windows drivers onboard,
 especially WAN dongles. When plugged in for the first time, they act
 like a flash storage and start installing the driver from there. If
 the driver is already installed, the storage device vanishes and
 a new device, such as an USB modem, shows up. This is called the
 "ZeroCD" feature.
 .
 On Debian, this is not needed, since the driver is included as a
 Linux kernel module, such as "usbserial". However, the device still
 shows up as "usb-storage" by default. usb-modeswitch solves that
 issue by sending the command which actually performs the switching
 of the device from "usb-storage" to "usbserial".

Description-md5: 63a4a740bcd9e8e94bf661e4f1806e02
Description-en: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

 unifont_csur.pcf.gz contains some scripts in the Plane 0 ConScript
 Unicode Registry (CSUR).  These scripts are not part of the Unicode
 Standard, but are a popular use for the Private Use Area (PUA).
 .
 Complex fonts (such as Indic or Semitic scripts, where letters change
 shape depending on their position in a word, or such as Mongolian, which
 can be written vertically) will not render perfectly.  The philosophy
 behind this font, though, is that anything meaningful is better than
 an empty box for an unknown glyph.
 .
 Consider using the TrueType version instead (ttf-unifont), because
 that version is scalable to any point size and has proper combining
 character support.

Package: xfonts-utils
Description-md5: cfb627fb99a0d0ef5d7b0b2f94423328

Package: xfsdump
Description-md5: 8448ced317c37d3587808bf000f24a98
Description-en: Administrative utilities for the XFS filesystem
 The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore and a number of
 other administrative utilities for managing XFS filesystems.
 .
 xfsdump examines files in a filesystem, determines which need to be
 backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other
 storage medium.  It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the
 dump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended
 attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are "endian safe" and can
 thus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures
 and also between IRIX machines.
 .
 xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a
 full backup of a filesystem.  Subsequent incremental backups can then
 be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory
 subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups.

 image. In this case, depending on the type of disk image, a secondary
 utility may be able to reduce the size of the disk image after
 zerofree has been run. Zerofree requires the file-system to be
 unmounted or mounted read-only.
 .
 The usual way to achieve the same result (zeroing the unused
 blocks) is to run "dd" to create a file full of zeroes that takes up
 the entire free space on the drive, and then delete this file. This
 has many disadvantages, which zerofree alleviates:
  * it is slow;
  * it makes the disk image (temporarily) grow to its maximal extent;
  * it (temporarily) uses all free space on the disk, so other
    concurrent write actions may fail.
 .
 Zerofree has been written to be run from GNU/Linux systems installed
 as guest OSes inside a virtual machine. If this is not your case, you
 almost certainly don't need this package. (One other use case would
 be to erase sensitive data a little bit more securely than with a
 simple "rm").

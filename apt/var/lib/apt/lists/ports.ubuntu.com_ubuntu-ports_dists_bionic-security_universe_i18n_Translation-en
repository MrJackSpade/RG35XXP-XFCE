Package: aapt
Description-md5: 975bf7a86058538d7263494591e4f7d8
Description-en: Android Asset Packaging Tool
 The Android Asset Packaging Tool (aapt) takes your application resource
 files, such as the AndroidManifest.xml file and the XML files for your
 Activities, and compiles them. An R.java is also produced so you can
 reference your resources from your Java code. This tool allows you to view,
 create, and update Zip-compatible archives (zip, jar, apk). It can also
 compile resources into binary assets.

Package: abcm2ps
Description-md5: dc3b0135560bf2cbe06ba992dbc0bb85
Description-en: Translates ABC music description files to PostScript
 This is the Debian port of the abcm2ps program by Jean-Fran√ßois Moine.
 The program translates tunes written in the ABC format to PostScript,
 which can then be viewed using Ghostview et al. or printed on a
 PostScript printer or through Ghostscript. It supports various
 semi-standard extensions to the ABC standard, such as multiple
 voices and staves.
 .
 This program is a vastly improved spin-off from Michael Methfessel's
 abc2ps, which is no longer supplied as part of Debian. In particular,
 it contains a lot of extensions to help typeset classical music.

Package: acmetool
Description-md5: 3e5e145ae880b97f3b6e825daf35ce32
Description-en: automatic certificate acquisition tool for Let's Encrypt
 acmetool is an easy-to-use command line tool for automatically
 acquiring TLS certificates from ACME (Automated Certificate Management
 Environment) servers such as Let's Encrypt, designed to flexibly
 integrate into your webserver setup to enable automatic verification.
 .
 acmetool is designed to work like make: you specify what certificates
 you want, and acmetool obtains certificates as necessary to satisfy
 those requirements. If the requirements are already satisfied,
 acmetool doesn't do anything when invoked. Thus, acmetool is
 ideally suited for use on a cron job; it will do nothing until
 certificates are near expiry, and then obtain new ones.
 .
 acmetool is designed to minimise the use of state and be transparent
 in the state that it does use. All state, including certificates, is
 stored in a single directory, by default /var/lib/acme. The schema
 for this directory is simple, comprehensible and documented.

Package: aide-dynamic
Description-md5: 3c085f51d721d7dcb93bb05d2c714096
Description-en: Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment - dynamic binary
 AIDE is an intrusion detection system that detects changes to files on
 the local system. It creates a database from the regular expression rules
 that it finds from the config file. Once this database is initialized
 it can be used to verify the integrity of the files. It has several
 message digest algorithms (md5, sha1, rmd160, tiger, haval, etc.) that are
 used to check the integrity of the file. More algorithms can be added
 with relative ease. All of the usual file attributes can also be checked
 for inconsistencies.
 .
 This package contains a dynamically linked binary and should only be
 used in exeptional circumstances. To avoid exposure to trojaned
 libraries, it is advised to use one of the statically linked binaries.

Package: aidl
Description-md5: 45859dc0b2ae5ed979acc57a859674e5
Description-en: Binder generator of AIDL interfaces
 aidl is a utility to generate Java and/or C++ code from Android's
 Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL). AIDL is similar to
 other IDLs you might have worked with. It allows you to define the
 programming interface that both the client and service agree upon in
 order to communicate with each other using interprocess communication
 (IPC). On Android, one process cannot normally access the memory of
 another process. So to talk, they need to decompose their objects
 into primitives that the operating system can understand, and
 marshall the objects across that boundary for you. The code to do
 that marshalling is tedious to write, so Android handles it for you
 with AIDL. This package provides two tools:
 .
   * "aidl" which generates Java bindings.
   * "aidl-cpp" which generates C++ bindings.
 .

Package: amanda-client
Description-md5: eb340217bc77fc442e67d6d525d8c0fb
Description-en: Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver (Client)
 Amanda is a backup system designed to archive many computers on a
 network to a single large-capacity tape drive. This package is
 suitable for large amounts of data to backup. For smaller solutions
 take a look at afbackup, tob, ...
 .
  Features:
   * will back up multiple machines in parallel to a holding disk, blasting
     finished dumps one by one to tape as fast as they can be can written to
     tape.  For example, a ~2 Gb 8mm tape on a ~240K/s interface to a host
     with a large holding disk can be filled by Amanda in under 4 hours.
   * built on top of standard backup software: Unix dump/restore, and
     later GNU Tar and others.
   * does simple tape management: will not overwrite the wrong tape.
   * supports tape changers via a generic interface.  Easily customizable
     to any type of tape carousel, robot, or stacker that can be controlled
     via the unix command line.
   * for a restore, tells you what tapes you need, and finds the proper
     backup image on the tape for you.
   * recovers gracefully from errors, including down or hung machines.
   * reports results, including all errors in detail, in email to operators.
   * will dynamically adjust backup schedule to keep within constraints:
     no more juggling by hand when adding disks and computers to network.
   * includes a pre-run checker program, that conducts sanity checks on both
     the tape server host and all the client hosts (in parallel), and will
     send an e-mail report of any problems that could cause the backups to
     fail.
   * can compress dumps before sending or after sending over the net, with
     either compress or gzip.
   * can optionally synchronize with external backups, for those large
     timesharing computers where you want to do full dumps when the system
     is down in single-user mode (since BSD dump is not reliable on active
     filesystems): Amanda will still do your daily dumps.
   * lots of other options; Amanda is very configurable.
 .
 THIS PACKAGE RELIES ON A RUNNING AMANDA SERVER IN YOUR NETWORK.

Description-en: Google's internal fork of OpenSSL for the Android SDK
 The Android SDK builds against a static version of BoringSSL,
 Google's internal fork of OpenSSL.  This package should never be used
 for anything but Android SDK packages that already depend on it.
 .
 BoringSSL arose because Google used OpenSSL for many years in various
 ways and, over time, built up a large number of patches that were
 maintained while tracking upstream OpenSSL. As Google‚Äôs product
 portfolio became more complex, more copies of OpenSSL sprung up and
 the effort involved in maintaining all these patches in multiple
 places was growing steadily.
 .
 This is the Android AOSP fork of BoringSSL which is designed to be
 used by Android and its SDK.  BoringSSL is only ever statically linked
 into apps, and pinned to a commit version.  Upstream has no official
 releases of BoringSSL on its own, so it must be included separately
 for each project that uses it.

Package: apksigner
Description-md5: 084b3acff7be60dc94f8caedfe355b64
Description-en: command line tool to sign and verify Android APKs
 apksig is a project which aims to simplify APK signing and checking
 whether APK's signatures should verify on Android. apksig supports
 JAR signing (used by Android since day one) and APK Signature Scheme
 v2 (supported since Android Nougat, API Level 24).
 .
 The key feature of apksig is that it knows about differences in APK
 signature verification logic between different versions of the
 Android platform. apksig can thus check whether a signed APK is
 expected to verify on all Android platform versions supported by the
 APK. When signing an APK, apksig will choose the most appropriate
 cryptographic algorithms based on the Android platform versions
 supported by the APK being signed.
 .
 apksigner command-line tool offers two operations:
 .
  * sign the provided APK so that it verifies on all Android platforms
 supported by the APK. Run apksigner sign for usage information.
 .
  * check whether the provided APK's signatures are expected to verify
 on all Android platforms supported by the APK. Run apksigner verify
 for usage information.
 .
 The tool determines the range of Android platform versions (API
 Levels) supported by the APK by inspecting the APK's
 AndroidManifest.xml. This behavior can be overridden by specifying
 the range of platform versions on the command-line.

Description-en: the digital audio workstation
 Ardour is a multichannel hard disk recorder (HDR) and digital audio
 workstation (DAW).  It can be used to control, record, edit and run
 complex audio setups.
 .
 Ardour supports pro-audio interfaces
 through the ALSA project, which provides high quality, well designed
 device drivers and API's for audio I/O under Linux. Any interface
 supported by ALSA can be used with Ardour. This includes the
 all-digital 26 channel RME Hammerfall, the Midiman Delta 1010 and many
 others.
 .
 Ardour has support for 24 bit samples
 using floating point internally, non-linear editing with unlimited undo,
 a user-configurable mixer, MTC master/slave capabilities, MIDI hardware
 control surface compatibility.
 .
 It supports MIDI
 Machine Control, and so can be controlled from any MMC controller and
 many modern digital mixers.
 .
 Ardour contains a
 powerful multitrack audio editor/arranger that is completely
 non-destructive and capable of all standard non-linear editing
 operations (insert, replace, delete, move, trim, select,
 cut/copy/paste). The editor has unlimited undo/redo capabilities and can
 save independent "versions" of a track or an entire piece
 .
 Ardour's editor supports the community-developed LADSPA
 plugin standard.  Arbitrary chains of plugins can be attached to any
 portion of a track.  Every mixer strip can have any number of inputs
 and outputs, not just mono, stereo or 5.1.  An N-way panner is
 included, with support for various panning models.  Pre- and post-fader
 sends exist, each with their own gain and pan controls.  Every mixer
 strip acts as its own bus, and thus the bus count in Ardour is
 unlimited.  You can submix any number of strips into another
 strip.
 .
 Ardour's channel capacity is limited only
 by the number on your audio interface and the ability of your disk
 subsystem to stream the data back and forth.
 .
 JACK
 (the JACK Audio Connection Kit) is used for all audio I/O, permitting
 data to be exchanged in perfect samplesync with other applications
 and/or hardware audio interfaces.
 .
 Ardour is
 sample rate and size neutral - any hardware formats from 8 to 32 bits,
 and rates from 8kHz to 192kHz.  Internal processing in 32/64 bit IEEE
 floating point format.

Package: busybox
Description-md5: b7707908219c331294f3f9e8d926a9dc
Description-en: Tiny utilities for small and embedded systems
 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.
 .
 This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install
 symlinks for any of the supported utilities. Some of the utilities
 can be used in the system by installing the busybox-syslogd,
 busybox-udhcpc or busybox-udhcpd packages.

Package: busybox-syslogd
Description-md5: 6d204aacbcadc9711030ab99f904ca3b
Description-en: Provides syslogd and klogd using busybox
 The system log daemon is responsible for providing logging of
 messages received from programs and facilities on the local host as
 well as from remote hosts.
 .
 The kernel log daemon listens to kernel message sources and is
 responsible for prioritizing and processing operating system
 messages.
 .
 The busybox implementation of the syslogd is particular useful on
 embedded, diskless (netboot) or flash disk based systems because it
 can use a fixed size ring buffer for logging instead of saving logs
 to the disk or sending it to remote logging servers. The ring buffer
 can be read using the (also busybox based) command logread.
 .
 This package provides the glue to the busybox syslogd and klogd to be
 used in the system by providing the appropriate symbolic links and
 scripts.

Package: bwa
Description-md5: 7b904940a9f5331affa84d4b72dedb30
Description-en: Burrows-Wheeler Aligner
 BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against
 a large reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of
 three algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first
 algorithm is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while
 the rest two for longer sequences ranged from 70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM
 and BWA-SW share similar features such as long-read support and split
 alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended
 for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM
 also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina
 reads.

Description-en: Certificate Transparency Log Monitor
 Cert Spotter is a Certificate Transparency log monitor from SSLMate that
 alerts you when a SSL/TLS certificate is issued for one of your domains.
 Cert Spotter is easier than other open source CT monitors, since it does
 not require a database. It's also more robust, since it uses a special
 certificate parser that ensures it won't miss certificates.
 .
 Cert Spotter is also available as a hosted service by SSLMate,
 <https://sslmate.com/certspotter>
 .
 You can use Cert Spotter to detect:
  * Certificates issued to attackers who have compromised a certificate
    authority and want to impersonate your site.
  * Certificates issued to attackers who are using your infrastructure
    to serve malware.
  * Certificates issued in violation of your corporate policy
    or outside of your centralized certificate procurement process.
  * Certificates issued to your infrastructure providers without your
    consent.

 Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual
 Machine. It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the
 approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with
 an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming.
 Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode,
 yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is
 supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java
 frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that
 calls to Java can avoid reflection.
 .
 Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data
 philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a
 functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable,
 persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers
 a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that
 ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.

 The implementation fully supports UDP, TCP, TLS, and DTLS as protocols between
 the TURN client and the TURN server. Both UDP and TCP relaying are supported.
 .
 SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Redis are supported for the user
 repository (if authentication is required).
 The long-term credentials mechanism is supported.
 For WebRTC applications,
 the TURN server REST API for time-limited
 secret-based authentication is implemented.
 The third-party authentication
 specs (OAuth-based) are supported, too.
 .
 Load balancing can be implemented either by DNS round-robin mechanism, or with
 the external networking tools, or by
 the built-in ALTERNATE-SERVER mechanism.
 .
 The implementation is intended to be simple to install and configure.

Package: coyim
Description-md5: a1aa812403b7246be602e0e623675ba9
Description-en: safe and secure XMPP chat client
 CoyIM is a chat client using the XMPP protocol. It is built upon
 https://github.com/agl/xmpp-client and https://github.com/twstrike/otr3.
 It adds a graphical user interface and tries to be safe and secure by default.
 The authors' ambition is that it should be possible for even the most
 high-risk people on the planet to safely use CoyIM, without having to make
 any configuration changes.
 .
 To do this, OTR is enabled by default, Tor is used by default, and the Tor
 Onion Service will be used for a server if it is known. Also, TLS and TLS
 certificates are used to verify the connection - no configuration necessary.
 The implementation is written in the Go language, to avoid many common types
 of vulnerabilities that come from using unsafe languages.

Package: ctdb
Description-md5: 83dff66615250b53a0cd3df6fb3b9ea7
Description-en: clustered database to store temporary data
 CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other
 projects to store temporary data. If an application is already using TDB for
 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware
 and use CTDB instead.
 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Description-en: Register a GSF ID for mock-up Android devices
 Dummy Droid allows you to create hardware profiles for arbitrary
 Android devices and upload them into your Google Play account,
 thereby creating a "Google Services Framework ID".

 Mocks can either be generated from the /system/build.prop file of
 existing hardware or be completely made up from scratch. You (may)
 need this tool if Google Play won't give you access to an app because
 of device incompatibilities, country or carrier restrictions. You
 (may) also need this tool if you are an app developer yourself and
 want to test compatibility filter settings without actually owning
 the target device.

 Word of warning: Dummy Droid grants you absolute freedom, including
 the freedom to specify absolute nonsense (such as a smart-tv with a
 screensize of 1 pixel). Please pay attention to the instructions and
 use a throw-away account for testing. Otherwise you might end up with
 dozens of mocks in your main account you cannot get rid of again!

Package: golang-1.13
Description-md5: 8650a23f44e2d60a785ad3123733d6d8
Description-en: Go programming language compiler - metapackage
 The Go programming language is an open source project to make
 programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and
 efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs
 that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its
 novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction.
 Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of
 garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a
 fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a
 dynamically typed, interpreted language.
 .
 This package is a metapackage that, when installed, guarantees
 that (most of) a full Go development environment is installed.

Package: graphicsmagick
Description-md5: 49dce754c724afc2a734936e7250be4b
Description-en: collection of image processing tools
 GraphicsMagick provides a set of command-line applications to manipulate
 image files. It is a fork of the ImageMagick project and therefore offers
 a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.
 .
 The tools support a large variety of image formats from the widely used
 jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or image
 formats found on some photo CDs. They can convert between formats,
 concatenate several images into one, annotate and distort them, create
 thumbnails or manipulate the colormap. While all features are available
 from the command-line, the package also includes an image viewer that
 allows interactive manipulation.
 .
 Note that unlike ImageMagick, the GraphicsMagick tools are accessed
 through a single executable called 'gm'. Therefore, GraphicsMagick and
 ImageMagick can be used in parallel. Install package
 graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat to obtain a set of several executables
 that is compatible to ImageMagick's interface.

Package: graphicsmagick-dbg
Description-md5: fcc436d75960b67f4f57213c969230ff
Description-en: format-independent image processing - debugging symbols
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers
 an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable
 across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the
 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,
 conversion can usually be done with little effort.
 .
 This package contains debugging symbols for the gm executable as well as the
 C, C++, and Perl bindings. Tools like gdb and ltrace make use of these
 symbols.

 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick libraries are a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offer
 programming interfaces that are mostly compatible. While there might be
 small differences, experience tells that many programs only use a compatible
 subset and build fine with either GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick.
 .
 While GraphicsMagick uses different names for libraries, classes, and
 helper applications in order to coexist with ImageMagick, this package
 intends to minimise porting efforts by exporting the GraphicsMagick
 interface with the usual ImageMagick names. Note that this package only
 tries to provide build-time compatibility. Run-time libraries of
 ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick are incompatible and cannot be interchanged.

 This package includes compatibility wrappers for the C, C++, and Perl
 libraries.

Package: libapksig-java
Description-md5: 7926f593443c8bc0a39626f9b0442a18
Description-en: library to sign and verify Android APKs
 apksig is a project which aims to simplify APK signing and checking
 whether APK's signatures should verify on Android. apksig supports
 JAR signing (used by Android since day one) and APK Signature Scheme
 v2 (supported since Android Nougat, API Level 24).
 .
 The key feature of apksig is that it knows about differences in APK
 signature verification logic between different versions of the
 Android platform. apksig can thus check whether a signed APK is
 expected to verify on all Android platform versions supported by the
 APK. When signing an APK, apksig will choose the most appropriate
 cryptographic algorithms based on the Android platform versions
 supported by the APK being signed.
 .
 apksig library offers three primitives:
 .
  * ApkSigner which signs the provided APK so that it verifies on all
 Android platform versions supported by the APK. The range of platform
 versions can be customized if necessary.
 .
  * ApkVerifier which checks whether the provided APK is expected to
 verify on all Android platform versions supported by the APK. The
 range of platform versions can be customized if necessary.
 .
  * (Default)ApkSignerEngine which abstracts away signing an APK from
 parsing and building an APK file. This is useful in optimized APK
 building pipelines, such as in Android Plugin for Gradle, which need
 to perform signing while building an APK, instead of after. For
 simpler use cases where the APK to be signed is available upfront,
 the ApkSigner above is easier to use.
 .
 NOTE: Some public classes of the library are in packages having the
 word ‚Äúinternal‚Äù in their name. These are not public API of the
 library. Do not use *.internal.* classes directly.

Description-en: Java bytecode manipulation framework
 ASM is an all purpose Java bytecode manipulation and analysis framework.
 It can be used to modify existing classes or dynamically generate classes,
 directly in binary form. Provided common transformations and analysis
 algorithms allow one to easily assemble custom complex transformations
 and code analysis tools.
 .
 ASM offer similar functionality as other bytecode frameworks, but it is
 focused on simplicity of use and performance. Because it was designed and
 implemented to be as small and as fast as possible, it makes it very
 attractive for using in dynamic systems.

 BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against
 a large reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of
 three algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first
 algorithm is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while
 the rest two for longer sequences ranged from 70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM
 and BWA-SW share similar features such as long-read support and split
 alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended
 for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM
 also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina
 reads.

 Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual
 Machine. It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the
 approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with
 an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming.
 Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode,
 yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is
 supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java
 frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that
 calls to Java can avoid reflection.
 .
 Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data
 philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a
 functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable,
 persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers
 a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that
 ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.

 all of its fuzzing inside a single process. This in-process fuzzing can be
 more restrictive and fragile, but is potentially much faster as there is no
 overhead for process start-up.
 .
 The fuzzer is linked with the library under test, and feeds fuzzed inputs to
 the library via a specific fuzzing entrypoint (aka 'target function'); the
 fuzzer then tracks which areas of the code are reached, and generates mutations
 on the corpus of input data in order to maximize the code coverage. The code
 coverage information for libFuzzer is provided by LLVM's SanitizerCoverage

 Gson Goals
 .
  * Provide simple toJson() and fromJson() methods to convert Java objects to
    JSON and vice-versa
  * Allow pre-existing unmodifiable objects to be converted to and from JSON
  * Extensive support of Java Generics
  * Allow custom representations for objects
  * Support arbitrarily complex objects (with deep inheritance hierarchies and
    extensive use of generic types)

Description-md5: 694d24fef1105bb316b3f9173117fd3c
Description-en: format-independent image processing - perl interface
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.

 The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers
 an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable

 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,
 conversion can usually be done with little effort.

 across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the
 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,
 conversion can usually be done with little effort.
 .
 This package contains the C development headers and library files needed to
 compile programs using the GraphicsMagick library.

Description-en: Hibernate Validator
 Hibernate Validator aims at defining and checking a domain model

 as full internationalization. Annotations are used to define
 constraints on object level. The validation mechanism can be executed
 in different layers in your application without having to duplicate
 any of these rules (presentation layer, data access layer, Database
 schema).
 .
 Hibernate Validator integrates with Hibernate by applying the
 constraints on the database schema (DDL generation) and by checking
 entity validity before Hibernate inserts or updates instances. You
 can use Hibernate Validator with any Java Persistence provider, not
 only Hibernate, although you will not be able to use automatic DDL
 alteration for constraint generation outside of Hibernate
 EntityManager.

Package: libhtml-stripscripts-perl
Description-md5: 5630c87178afcfe3f49d16005cba6177
Description-en: module for removing scripts from HTML
 HTML::StripScripts is a Perl module for neutralizes scripting constructs in
 HTML, leaving as much non-scripting markup in place as possible. This allows
 web applications to display HTML originating from an untrusted source without
 introducing cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
 .
 The process is based on whitelists of tags, attributes and attribute values.
 This approach is the most secure against disguised scripting constructs hidden
 in malicious HTML documents.
 .
 As well as removing scripting constructs, this module ensures that there is a
 matching end for each start tag, and that the tags are properly nested.
 .
 You will probably use HTML::StripScripts::Parser rather than using this module
 directly (see libhtml-stripscripts-parser-perl).

Package: libjavaewah-java

Description-en: Compressed variant of the Java bitset class
 The bit array data structure is implemented in Java as the BitSet class.
 Unfortunately, this fails to scale without compression.
 .
 JavaEWAH is a word-aligned compressed variant of the Java bitset class. It uses
 a 64-bit run-length encoding (RLE) compression scheme. It trades-off some
 compression for better processing speed. It also has a 32-bit version which
 compresses better, but is not as fast.
 .
 In general, the goal of word-aligned compression is not to achieve the best
 compression, but rather to improve query processing time. Hence, the class
 tries to save CPU cycles, maybe at the expense of storage. However, the EWAH
 scheme implemented is always more efficient storage-wise than an uncompressed
 bitmap as implemented in the BitSet class). Unlike some alternatives, javaewah
 does not rely on a patented scheme.

Description-en: Implementation of JSR 243: Java Data Objects 3.1
 Java Data Objects (JDO) is a standard way to access persistent data in
 databases, using plain old Java objects (POJO) to represent persistent data.
 The approach separates data manipulation (done by accessing Java data members
 in the Java domain objects) from database manipulation (done by calling the
 JDO interface methods). This separation of concerns leads to a high degree of
 independence of the Java view of data from the database view of the data.
 .
 Interfaces are defined for the user's view of persistence:
  - PersistenceManager: the component responsible for the life cycle of
    persistent instances, Query factory, and Transaction access
  - Query: the component responsible for querying the datastore and returning
    persistent instances or values
  - Transaction: the component responsible for initiating and completing
    transactions
 .
 JDO is being developed as a Java Specification Request in the Java Community
 Process. The original JDO 1.0 is JSR-12 http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=12
 and the current JDO 2.0 is JSR-243 http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=243

Description-en: Logging library for java
 log4j is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of
 output targets.
 .
 It is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application
 binary. The log4j package is designed so that log statements can remain in
 shipped code without incurring a high performance cost.
 .
 One of the distinctive features of log4j is the notion of hierarchical
 loggers. Using loggers it is possible to selectively control which log
 statements are output at arbitrary granularity.
 .
 Log4j can output to: a file, a rolling file, a database with a JDBC driver,
 many output  asynchronously, a JMS Topic, a swing based logging console,
 the NT event log, /dev/null, a SMTP server (using javamail), a socket server,
 syslog, telnet daemon and stdout.
 .
 The format of the output can be defined using one of the various layout
 (or user defined layout) like: simple text, html, date, pattern defined and
 XML.

Description-md5: 45f804957a9794c4f807c12a4e0985f7
Description-en: Apache Log4j - Logging Framework for Java
 Apache Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements
 over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x:
 .
 API Separation: The API for Log4j is separate from the implementation making
 it clear for application developers which classes and methods they can use
 while ensuring forward compatibility.
 .
 Improved Performance: Log4j 2 contains next-generation Asynchronous Loggers
 based on the LMAX Disruptor library. In multi-threaded scenarios Asynchronous
 Loggers have 10 times higher throughput and orders of magnitude lower latency
 than Log4j 1.x.
 .
 Support for multiple APIs: While the Log4j 2 API will provide the best
 performance, Log4j 2 provides support for the SLF4J and Commons Logging APIs.
 .
 Automatic Reloading of Configurations: Log4j 2 can automatically reload its
 configuration upon modification. It will do so without losing log events
 while reconfiguration is taking place.
 .
 Advanced Filtering: Log4j 2 supports filtering based on context
 data, markers, regular expressions, and other components in the Log event.
 Filtering can be specified to apply to all events before being passed to
 Loggers or as they pass through Appenders.
 .
 Plugin Architecture: Log4j uses the plugin pattern to configure components.
 As such, no code is needed to create and configure an Appender, Layout,
 Pattern Converter, and so on. Log4j automatically recognizes plugins
 and uses them when a configuration references them.
 .
 Property Support: Properties can be referenced in a configuration, Log4j will
 directly replace them, or Log4j will pass them to an underlying component that
 will dynamically resolve them. Properties come from values defined in the
 configuration file, system properties, environment variables, the
 ThreadContext Map, and data present in the event.

Package: libobjenesis-java
Description-md5: 41a22df421c52c7dab71183e98808e36
Description-en: Java library to instantiate a new object of a particular class
 Objenesis is a small Java library that serves one purpose: to instantiate a
 new object of a particular class.
 Java already supports this dynamic instantiation of classes using
 Class.newInstance(). However, this only works if the class has an appropriate
 constructor. There are many times when a class cannot be instantiated this
 way, such as when the class contains:
  * Constructors that require arguments.
  * Constructors that have side effects.
  * Constructors that throw exceptions.
 As a result, it is common to see restrictions in libraries stating that
 classes must require a default constructor.
 Objenesis aims to overcomes these restrictions by bypassing the constructor
 on object instantiation.

 simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can
 use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
 data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
 You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs
 that are compiled against the "old" format.
 .
 Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and
 file formats.

 This package contains the Java bindings for the protocol buffers. You will
 need the protoc tool (in the protobuf-compiler package) to compile your
 definition to Java classes, and then the modules in this package will allow
 you to use those classes in your programs.

Description-en: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - development files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").

 Tomcat can use the Apache Portable Runtime to provide superior scalability,
 performance, and better integration with native server technologies.
 The Apache Portable Runtime is a highly portable library that is at the
 heart of Apache HTTP Server 2.x. APR has many uses, including access to
 advanced IO functionality (such as sendfile, epoll and OpenSSL), OS level
 functionality (random number generation, system status, etc), and native
 process handling (shared memory, NT pipes and Unix sockets).

 enable much better integration with other native web technologies, and
 overall make Java much more viable as a full fledged webserver platform
 rather than simply a backend focused technology.

 sun.misc.Unsafe is Java class in Oracle JDKs that provides a collection of
 methods for performing low-level, unsafe operations.
 .
 Although the class and all methods are public, use of this class is limited
 because only trusted code can obtain instances of it.
 .
 unsafe-mock provides a current version of sun.misc.Unsafe that
 supports all APIs up through the new "fences" API in Java 8 EA builds
 b71 and later. This Unsafe is a copy of the one from Java 8 EA build
 b71, and it is expected that if you want to build against it you put
 it in javac's bootclasspath. You are responsible for determining in
 your own code whether you can access Unsafe and which methods are
 available; this library is only to provide an all-inclusive Unsafe
 against which you can compile using JDKs <= 8.0.

Description-md5: 10c1dedc8716f96d83e51d094ab4032b
Description-en: Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again
 The features of the XStream library are:
 .
  - Ease of use. A high level facade is supplied that simplifies common
    use cases.
  - No mappings required. Most objects can be serialized without need
    for specifying mappings.
  - Performance. Speed and low memory footprint are a crucial part of
    the design, making it suitable for large object graphs or systems
    with high message throughput.
  - Clean XML. No information is duplicated that can be obtained via
    reflection. This results in XML that is easier to read for humans
    and more compact than native Java serialization.
  - Requires no modifications to objects. Serializes internal fields,
    including private and final. Supports non-public and inner classes.
    Classes are not required to have default constructor.
  - Full object graph support. Duplicate references encountered in the
    object-model will be maintained. Supports circular references.
  - Integrates with other XML APIs. By implementing an interface,
    XStream can serialize directly to/from any tree structure (not just
    XML).
  - Customizable conversion strategies. Strategies can be registered
    allowing customization of how particular types are represented as
    XML.
  - Error messages. When an exception occurs due to malformed XML,
    detailed diagnostics are provided to help isolate and fix the
    problem.
  - Alternative output format. The modular design allows other output
    formats. XStream ships currently with JSON support and morphing.

Description-md5: 3678f13807c05861be8c708a652e8e9d
Description-en: Precision Time Protocol (PTP, IEEE1588) implementation for Linux
 Linuxptp is an implementation of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
 according to IEEE standard 1588 for Linux. Features include:
  - support for hardware and software time stamping via the Linux
    SO_TIMESTAMPING socket option.
  - support for the Linux PTP Hardware Clock (PHC) subsystem by using the
    clock_gettime family of calls, including the new clock_adjtimex
    system call
  - implementation of Boundary Clock (BC) and Ordinary Clock (OC)
  - transport over UDP/IPv4, UDP/IPv6, and raw Ethernet (Layer 2)
  - support for IEEE 802.1AS-2011 in the role of end station
 .
 PTP provides higher precision and faster synchronization than NTP even
 without hardware support. With hardware support, sub-microsecond
 accuracy can be expected. Whereas NTP is intended for WAN use, PTP is
 designed for LAN environments and makes use of UDP multicast.

Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X96, SparcV10, PowerPC or many other architectures.

Description-md5: b9c201f42c4b4fea02c357189015a9c0
Description-en: low level cryptographic library (binary tools)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains binary utilities that accompany the library:
 .
    - nettle-lfib-stream - generates a pseudo-random stream, using the Knuth
      lfib (non-cryptographic) pseudo-random generator.
    - sexp-conv - conversion tool for handling the different flavours of sexp
      syntax.
    - pkcs1-conv - converts PKCS#1 keys to sexp format.
    - nettle-hash - command-line tool to compute message digests such as SHA-1.

 Underscore provides 60-odd functions that support both the usual
 functional suspects: map, select, invoke - as well as more specialized
 helpers: function binding, javascript templating, deep equality
 testing, and so on.  It delegates to built-in functions, if present, so

 The url-parse method exposes two different API interfaces. The url interface
 that you know from Node.js and the new URL interface that is available in
 the latest browsers.
 .
 Since 0.1 we've moved away from using the DOM's <a> element for URL parsing
 and moving to a full Regular Expression solution. The main reason for this
 change is to make the URL parser available in different JavaScript
 environments as you don't always have access to the DOM like Worker
 environments.  This module still have a really small foot print as this
 module's main intention is to be bundled with client-side code. The only
 problem however with a RegExp based solution is that it required a lot of
 lookups causing major problems in FireFox. So the last and the current
 solution was a pure string parsing solution which chops up the URL in
 smaller pieces.

 versioned filesystem trees. It is like git in that it checksums
 individual files and has a content-addressed object store; unlike git,
 it "checks out" the files using hardlinks into an immutable directory
 tree. This can be used to provide atomic upgrades with rollback, history
 and parallel-installation, particularly useful on "fixed purpose"
 systems such as embedded devices.
 .
 This package contains the executables used to manage and create
 filesystem trees. It does not affect the boot process for the system
 on which it is installed.

 intervening steps. It's therefore extremely fast, and flexible (since
 you're using a full-blown programming language).
 .
 Sample use cases are:
   * Dynamic PDF generation on the web
   * High-volume corporate reporting and database publishing
   * As embeddable print engine for other applications, including a
     'report language' so that users can customize their own reports.
   * As 'build system' for complex documents with charts, tables and text
     such as management accounts, statistical reports and scientific papers
   * from XML to PDF in one step

Package: sia
Description-md5: ad065d9d74c6eb3eeeab33e17b67e849
Description-en: Blockchain-based marketplace for file storage
 Sia is a decentralized cloud storage platform aimed at giving users
 control of their data. Data is split into hundreds of erasure coded
 pieces and encrypted locally, and then each piece is uploaded to a
 separate host. A blockchain is used to create cryptographic contracts
 ensuring that hosts will only get paid if they actually store the
 data. Out of hundreds of hosts, only a fraction are required to
 recover the original file.
 .
 Anybody can join the network as a host and get income from the
 storage they contribute. This openness allows Sia to build and take
 advantage of a global network of small datacenters. Combined with
 advanced algorithms for storing and retrieving data, Sia is poised to
 be a highly competitive cloud storage platform. More information
 about the technology can be found on our website and in the 'doc'
 folder of the repo.
 .
 Sia is ready for use with small sums of money and non-critical files,
 but until the network has a more proven track record, we advise
 against using it as a sole means of storing important data.

Package: tcpflow
Description-md5: 8b5d860e2da32a9ce8f2c9689abca505
Description-en: TCP flow recorder
 tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP
 connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient
 for protocol analysis or debugging. A program like 'tcpdump' shows a
 summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the
 data that's actually being transmitted. In contrast, tcpflow
 reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in a
 separate file for later analysis.
 .
 tcpflow understands sequence numbers and will correctly reconstruct
 data streams regardless of retransmissions or out-of-order delivery.
 However, it currently does not understand IP fragments; flows
 containing IP fragments will not be recorded properly.
 .
 tcpflow is based on the LBL Packet Capture Library and therefore
 supports the same rich filtering expressions that programs like
 'tcpdump' support. tcpflow can also rebuild flows from data captured
 with 'tcpdump -w'.

Description-en: cleans up files in directories based on their age
 This package provides a program that can be used to clean out temporary-file
 directories.  It recursively searches the directory, refusing to chdir()
 across symlinks, and removes files that haven't been accessed in a
 user-specified amount of time.  You can specify a set of files to protect
 from deletion with a shell pattern.  It will not remove files owned by the
 process EUID that have the `w' bit clear, unless you ask it to, much like
 `rm -f'.  `tmpreaper' will not remove symlinks, sockets, fifos, or special
 files unless given a command line option enabling it to.
 .
 WARNING:  Please do not run `tmpreaper' on `/'.  There are no protections
 against this written into the program, as that would prevent it from
 functioning the way you'd expect it to in a `chroot(8)' environment.
 .
 The daily tmpreaper run can be configured through /etc/tmpreaper.conf .

Package: xnest
Description-md5: 8fb9e95ed5f9c018992a8cdc83935474
Description-en: Nested X server
 Xnest is a nested X server that simply relays all its requests to another
 X server, where it runs as a client.  This means that it appears as another
 window in your current X session.  Xnest relies upon its parent X server
 for font services.
 .
 Use of the Xephyr X server instead of Xnest is recommended.

Description-en: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the x11-utils
 package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the
 KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the
 previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.
 .
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.
 .
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package.
 .
 Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the
 xfonts-cyrillic package as well.

Description-en: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.

Package: xzdec
Description-md5: 30227ffce3f42144b3b624776f996bbf
Description-en: XZ-format compression utilities - tiny decompressors
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the xzdec and lzmadec utilities, which write
 the decompressed version of a compressed file to standard output. The
 binaries are very small, so they can be easily stored on small media
 with some compressed files, and they are linked statically against
 liblzma so they can be used on machines without a compatible version
 of liblzma installed. However, they have:
 .
   * no compression support;
   * no support for writing to a file other than standard output;
   * no translated messages;
   * been optimized for size rather than speed.
 .
 For a full-featured xzcat command without these limitations, use
 the xz-utils package instead.

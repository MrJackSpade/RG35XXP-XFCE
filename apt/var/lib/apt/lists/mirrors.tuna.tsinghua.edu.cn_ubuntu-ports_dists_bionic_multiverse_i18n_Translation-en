 tiles available if you dislike ASCII gaming). Angband has been in more or
 less continuous development since the early 1990s.

Package: boinc-virtualbox
Description-md5: 690093958a0070907b98b36b21fb062c
Description-en: metapackage for virtualbox-savvy projects
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 Regular users (righteously) often find it an unbearable nuisance to
 care for the exact configuration of BOINC for virtualbox-based projects.
 This package adds a series of dependencies from the contrib
 section to the regular boinc package. This also meant this binary
 package to be redistributed in the contrib section of Debian.

Description-en: client to donate unused CPU cycles to distributed.net
 Donate your extra CPU cycles to a worthy cause!
 .
 distributed.net started in 1997 as a project whose purpose was to win a
 series of contests sponsored by RSA Data Security Inc., to crack their RC5
 encryption by brute-force methods. These contests were meant to show
 governments of nations such as the United States, who limit exports or
 use of cryptography, that the standards allowed are too weak for general
 use.
 .
 Since this time, distributed.net's focus has changed from solely
 cracking RSA's RC5 and DES projects to working on more diverse
 distributed computing problems.
 .
 The ongoing projects are RC5-72 and Optimal Golomb Rulers (28-mark), the
 latter of which has practical applications in science. There are also a
 number of other projects which are either periodic or upcoming. You may
 choose which project you wish to participate in.
 .
 Installing this package will allow unused CPU cycles on your computer to
 contribute to cracking the code. There should be no noticeable slowdown of
 your system, since the client runs niced, and only uses CPU time when
 your computer would otherwise be idle.

Package: dynare-matlab
Description-md5: 90e8fcabb135fcf60e09f0be51774946
Description-en: MATLAB support for Dynare
 Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in
 particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping
 generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on
 the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations
 about the future in a way consistent with the model. But Dynare is also able
 to handle models where expectations are formed differently: on one extreme,
 models where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme,
 models where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the
 state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning
 process. In terms of types of agents, models solved by Dynare can incorporate
 consumers, productive firms, governments, monetary authorities, investors and
 financial intermediaries. Some degree of heterogeneity can be achieved by
 including several distinct classes of agents in each of the aforementioned
 agent categories.
 .
 Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these models. It
 is able to perform simulations of the model given a calibration of the model
 parameters and is also able to estimate these parameters given a dataset. In
 practice, the user will write a text file containing the list of model
 variables, the dynamic equations linking these variables together, the
 computing tasks to be performed and the desired graphical or numerical
 outputs.
 .
 This package is only useful to users having MATLAB installed on their
 machine. It contains the source of the MEX files and will recompile them using
 the existing MATLAB installation.

Description-en: Launcher for proprietary games
 Various games are divided into two logical parts: engine
 and data. Often the engine and data are licensed in
 different ways, such that the engine can be distributed
 in Debian but the data cannot.

 Some of the games supported by game-data-packager need to be
 started by a special launcher script that will create symbolic
 links or do other setup. This package contains those launcher
 scripts.
 .
 The following games currently require this package:
 .
  * Doom 2: The Master Levels
  * Quake series
  * Unreal
  * Unreal Gold

Package: jhove
Description-md5: efc4e2b654349825dd35b596c3f9fdb9
Description-en: JSTOR/Harvard Object Validation Environment
 The concept of representation format, or type, permeates all technical
 areas of digital repositories. Policy and processing decisions
 regarding object ingest, storage, access, and preservation are
 frequently conditioned on a per-format basis. In order to achieve
 necessary operational efficiencies, repositories need to be able to
 automate these procedures to the fullest extent possible.
 JSTOR and the Harvard University Library are collaborating on a
 project to develop an extensible framework for format validation:
 JHOVE (pronounced "jove"), the JSTOR/Harvard Object Validation
 Environment. The initial release of JHOVE includes modules for
 arbitrary byte streams, ASCII and UTF-8 encoded text, GIF, JPEG2000,
 and JPEG, and TIFF images, AIFF and WAVE audio, PDF, HTML, and XML;

 The Computer Aided Drug Discovery (CADD) Pipeline is a workflow
 environment designed to support molecular dyanmics simulations
 and virtual screening experiments for in silico drug discovery,
 with a special focus on supporting the use of the Relaxed
 Complex Scheme. It includes web based access to applications
 such as NAMD, AutoDock, PDB2PQR, APBS, MGLToos and couples them
 in a flexible and scalable fashion through cloud computing.
 It is developed as a standalone application, using Vision
 (https://www.nbcr.net/pub/wiki/index.php?title=MGLTools#Vision) as
 the backend engine for visual programming and workflow execution.
 The scientific applications are made accessible through CADD using
 Opal Web services (https://www.nbcr.net/pub/wiki/index.php?title=Opal)
 for scalable and distributed computation.
 .
 The workflow components of the CADD pipeline are currently released
 as Vision networks packaged for specific processes in a modular
 fashion. These modules may be coupled at ease for more complex
 processes. In the future, they may also be accessible from workflow
 repositories such as MyExperiment.org, and from AutoDockTools.  The Opal
 services used in the CADD workflow may be accessed using programmatic
 access, the Opal Server Dashboard or other workflow clients such as
 Kepler, VisTrails or Taverna through Opal plugins available at Opal
 Sourceforge website (http://opal.nbcr.net).

Description-en: find issues in MP3 files and help to solve them
 MP3 Diags is a GUI-based application that allows end-users to identify issues
 with their MP3 files, fix some of the issues and make other changes, like
 adding track information. It also allows user to "look inside" an MP3 file.
 .
 Unlike some programs that are designed to deal with a single topic (like
 fixing VBR headers or adding cover art), MP3 Diags is a one stop solution
 that identifies more than 50 different issues in MP3 files and provides the
 means to fix many of them.
 .
 Some of the more important issues that are found:
 .
  * Broken tags / headers / audio.
  * Duplicate tags / headers.
  * Incorrect placement of tags / headers (ID3V2, ID3V1, LAME, Xing, etc).
  * Low quality audio.
  * Missing VBR header.
  * Missing track info / cover art.
  * Broken track info / cover art.
  * Missing normalization data.
  * Character encoding issues (for languages other than English).
 .
 Some of the fixes and changes that MP3 Diags can do:
 .
  * Adding / fixing track info, including album cover; information can be
    retrieved from several sources: Internet, clipboard, file name, local
    files, and (obviously) keyboard.
  * Correcting files that show incorrect song duration.

Package: proj-rdnap
Description-md5: b1f287e6b969763e383e09006074ff23
Description-en: RDNAP grid correction files for PROJ.4
 Kadaster and Rijkswaterstaat CIV, working together under the name RDNAP,
 developed RDNAPTRANS™2008, the precise and official transformation
 between ETRS89 and the dutch national horizontal and vertical coordinate
 reference systems the Stelsel van de Rijksdriehoeksmeting (RD) and the
 Normaal Amsterdams Peil (NAP). A ‘simplified’ procedure has been
 developed which uses a NTv2-grid for the transformation between ETRS89
 and RD as well as a VDatum-grid for the transformation between ETRS89
 and NAP. This ‘simplified’ procedure has the following limitations:
 .
  1) The rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid can only give identical results to
     RDNAPTRANS™2008 within 1 millimeter at ground level onshore and at
     mean sea level offshore. The horizontal deviation is approximately
     1 millimeter per 50 meter height difference from ground level or mean
     sea level.
  2) An exception to 1) is the border of the RDNAPTRANS™2008 correction
     grid. Transformation results within cells of the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid
     that are intersected by the border of the RDNAPTRANS™2008 correction
     grid can result in deviations of up to 20 centimeter.
  3) The naptrans2008 VDatum-grid cannot be used to determine deflections
     of the vertical. For this the NLGEO2004 geoid model has to be used.
  4) The naptrans2008 VDatum-grid is referenced to the Bessel-1841 ellipsoid
     and cannot be used stand-alone, it has to be used in combination with
     the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid.
 .
 Taking into account the limitations listed above, the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid
 and naptrans2008 VDatum-grid can be used as an alternative to
 RDNAPTRANS™2008 to transform geographic ETRS89-coordinates to
 projected RD-coordinates with grid correction applied and NAP-heights.
 .
 Note that, although the resulting RD/NAP and ETRS89 coordinates from the
 transformation will be correct, geographic Bessel-1841 coordinates will
 differ in both procedures and should only be considered as an intermediate
 result.

Package: python3-pycuda
Description-md5: 4f446cb70e3ba6723eaae62a94efb36c
Description-en: Python 3 module to access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API
 PyCUDA lets you access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API from Python.
 Several wrappers of the CUDA API already exist–so what’s so special about
 PyCUDA?
  * Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom, often called
    RAII in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and crash-free
    code.  PyCUDA knows about dependencies, too, so (for example) it won’t
    detach from a context before all memory allocated in it is also freed.
  * Convenience. Abstractions like pycuda.driver.SourceModule and
    pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray make CUDA programming even more convenient than
    with Nvidia’s C-based runtime.
  * Completeness. PyCUDA puts the full power of CUDA’s driver API at your
    disposal, if you wish.
  * Automatic Error Checking. All CUDA errors are automatically translated
    into Python exceptions.
  * Speed. PyCUDA’s base layer is written in C++, so all the niceties
    above are virtually free.
  * Helpful Documentation.

Package: r-cran-rjsonio
Description-md5: a1c3b21ba9a9359eb5d9c2ddb5c852aa
Description-en: Serialize R objects to JSON, JavaScript Object Notation
 Allows conversion to and from data in Javascript object notation (JSON)
 format. This allows R objects to be inserted into
 Javascript/ECMAScript/ActionScript code and allows R programmers to read
 and convert JSON content to R objects. This is an alternative to rjson
 package. Originally, that was too slow for converting large R objects to
 JSON and was not extensible. rjson's performance is now similar to this
 package, and perhaps slightly faster in some cases. This package uses
 methods and is readily extensible by defining methods for different classes,
 vectorized operations, and C code and callbacks to R functions for
 deserializing JSON objects to R. The two packages intentionally share
 the same basic interface. This package (RJSONIO) has many additional
 options to allow customizing the generation and processing of JSON
 content. This package uses libjson rather than implementing yet another
 JSON parser. The aim is to support other general projects by building
 on their work, providing feedback and benefit from their ongoing development.

 discrete-space setups such as the spatially enriched
 Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) models, or
 continuous-space point process data such as the occurrence of infectious
 diseases. Main focus is on outbreak detection in count data time series
 originating from public health surveillance of communicable diseases,
 but applications could just as well originate from environmetrics,
 reliability engineering, econometrics or social sciences.
 .
 Currently, the package contains implementations of many typical
 outbreak detection procedures such as Farrington et al (1996), Noufaily
 et al (2012) or the negative binomial LR-CUSUM method described in Höhle
 and Paul (2008). A novel CUSUM approach combining logistic and
 multinomial logistic modelling is also included.  Furthermore, inference
 methods for the retrospective infectious disease models in Held et al
 (2005), Held et al (2006), Paul et al (2008), Paul and Held (2011), Held
 and Paul (2012), and Meyer and Held (2014) are provided.
 .
 Continuous self-exciting spatio-temporal point processes are modeled
 through additive-multiplicative conditional intensities as described in
 Höhle (2009) ('twinSIR', discrete space) and Meyer et al (2012)
 ('twinstim', continuous space).
 .
 The package contains several real-world data sets, the ability to
 simulate outbreak data, visualize the results of the monitoring in
 temporal, spatial or spatio-temporal fashion.
 .

 SiSU is a lightweight markup based, command line oriented, document
 structuring, publishing and search framework for document collections.
 .
 With minimal preparation of a plain-text, (UTF-8) file, using its native
 markup syntax in your text editor of choice, SiSU can generate various
 document formats (most of which share a common object numbering system for
 locating content), including plain text, HTML, XHTML, XML, EPUB, OpenDocument
 text (ODF:ODT), LaTeX, PDF files, and populate an SQL database with objects
 (roughly paragraph-sized chunks) so searches may be performed and matches
 returned with that degree of granularity: your search criteria is met by these
 documents and at these locations within each document. Object numbering is
 particularly suitable for "published" works (finalized texts as opposed to
 works that are frequently changed or updated) for which it provides a fixed
 means of reference of content. Document outputs also share semantic meta-data
 provided.
 .
 SiSU also provides concordance files, document content certificates and
 manifests of generated output.
 .
 man pages, and interactive help are provided.
 .
 Dependencies for additional features are taken care of in sisu related
 packages.
 .
 The dummy package sisu-complete together with sisu-markup-samples installs

Package: snaphu
Description-md5: 6ac13ac4c3384f0d55c3268461aa73d3
Description-en: Statistical-Cost, Network-Flow Algorithm for 2D Phase Unwrapping
 Two-dimensional phase unwrapping is the process of recovering
 unambiguous phase data from a 2-D array of phase values known only
 modulo 2pi rad.
 .
 There are many applications, like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), fringe pattern analysis, tomography
 and spectroscopy, which as part of their fundamental operation depend
 upon the extraction of a phase signal from their input image. Usually
 the phase is available in a form that suffers from 2-pi phase jumps
 due to the use of the mathematical arctangent function, which produces
 an inherently wrapped output. This wrapped phase is unusable until the
 phase discontinuities are removed.
 .
 SNAPHU is an implementation of the Statistical-cost, Network-flow
 Algorithm for Phase Unwrapping particularly suitable for SAR
 interferometry applications. This algorithm poses phase unwrapping as
 a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation problem, the
 objective of which is to compute the most likely unwrapped solution
 given the observable input data. Because the statistics relating the
 input data to the solution depend on the measured quantity, SNAPHU
 incorporates three built-in statistical models, for topography data,
 deformation data, and smooth generic data. The posed optimization
 problem is solved approximately with use of network-flow techniques.
 .
 As SNAPHU uses an iterative optimization procedure, its execution time
 depends on the difficulty of the interferogram. In single-tile mode
 the required memory is on the order of 100 MB per 1,000,000 pixels in
 the input interferogram.

Package: tome
Description-md5: 9efcf47839037501aa7357051f1287d3
Description-en: single-player text-based roguelike dungeon simulation game
 Tome, short for Troubles of Middle Earth, is a single-player,
 text-based, dungeon simulation derived from the game angband, which
 in turn is derived from the older game Moria, which was in turn based
 on Rogue. It is often described as a "roguelike" game because the
 look and feel of the game is still quite similar to Rogue.
 .
 In tome, the  player may choose from a number of races and classes
 when creating a character, and then "run" that character over a
 period of days, weeks, even months, attempting to win the game by
 defeating Morgoth, who lurks somewhere in  the depths of the dungeon.
 .
 The ultimate goal of the game is to develop a character strong enough
 to defeat Morgoth, who resides on dungeon level 100. Upon doing so,
 you will receive the exalted status of "winner" and your character may
 retire.
 .
 The first main difference from Angband a new player to ToME will need
 to be aware of is that it has implemented a skills based system where
 instead of the  adventurer automatically improving in their abilities
 as they become more experienced, they get 5 skill points to spend on
 their character's abilities and can therefore customise what type of
 character they play. See the skills help file for details
 .
 The second major difference is that the main dungeon from Angband has
 been split  into 4 "dungeons", each of which cover a different
 portion of the dungeon's  levels. Note that not all of the places are
 actually "dungeons" - some are caves, forests, etc.
 .
 The third main difference between Vanilla Angband and ToME is the
 difference  in character classes and races, as well as a very
 different  magic system. ToME also offers the player the ability to
 undertake a series of  quests. It is not required for any adventurer
 to undertake  the fixed  quests, but they can result in some nice
 rewards.
 .
 Morgoth was 'the Dark Enemy of Middle-Earth' during its First Age. He
 was banished by the Valar (offspring of Eru, "god" of J.R.R.
 Tolkien's world) at the end of the First Age and thus never appears
 in The Lord of the Rings, set during the Third Age. Sauron, who does
 figure into those tales, was the most powerful of his servants. Read
 Tolkien's 'The Silmarillion' for more on the legends of Middle-Earth.
 Angband is a reference to Morgoth's "prison of iron."

Description-md5: 57f4018681a35e8477bb6cfd59d27ec8
Description-en: Threaded USENET news reader, based on rn (4.0 beta test)
 trn is a threaded news reader with a long history, descended from Larry
 Wall's rn (part of the second generation of newsreaders).  It has a
 powerful full screen text mode user interface, where most actions are
 available at the press of a single key.  It is highly configurable.
 .
 This version of trn reads news from a news server via NNTP (the Network
 News Transfer Protocol).  You must have a news server available - large
 sites usually provide a site-wide server.
 .
 If you install a news server on your system (either containing just
 local newsgroups or with a partial or full USENET feed) you can
 configure trn to access it.  In this case you will also need to install
 an appropriate 'inews' package for local posting.
 .
 This is a separate package from trn because trn 4.0 has enough
 substantial changes in its default behaviour (for instance, the group
 selector is new in 4.0) that some users prefer to stay with an older
 version of trn.

 giving less than one false positive per 15 gigabases. Two previously described
 tRNA detection programs are used as fast, first-pass prefilters to identify
 candidate tRNAs, which are then analyzed by a highly selective tRNA covariance
 model. This work represents a practical application of RNA covariance models,
 which are general, probabilistic secondary structure profiles based on
 stochastic context-free grammars. tRNAscan-SE searches at ~ 30 000 bp/s.
